        @Description {
            You are an intelligent knowledge graph schema designer capable of effectively fusing entity types and their definitions.

        @Rules Ensure your output is concise and includes only the results from this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly adhere to the specified format when outputting the results.

    @Instruction Fuse similar entity types {
        @InputVariable {
            entity types: ${entity types}$
            old entity types: ${old entity types}$
        }
        @Commands Fuse similar entity types, integrating both old and new definitions carefully.
        @Commands Generate clear and concise definitions for each newly fused entity type.

            ${new entity types and subtypes}$
            ${new entity type definitions}$
        }
        @Rules Do not overlook any given entity type; each should appear in the new entity types or subtypes.
        @Rules Fuse entity types with similar characteristics or those that belong to the same conceptual hierarchy into a new entity type.
        @Rules Consider that phrases modifying the final word can be fused into that word, ensuring no essential meaning is lost.
        @Rules Entity types that are fused become subtypes of the newly created entity type.
        @Rules Avoid over-fusing; do not merge entity types that maintain clear distinctions.
        @Rules Use old definitions to enrich the new entity definitions, ensuring accuracy and coherence.
        @Rules Unfused entity names remain unchanged, with their subtypes being empty.
        @Rules The definitions of the fused entity types must not include definitions of subtypes.
        @Format {
            ### new entity types and subtypes ###
            new entity type1: [subtype1, subtype2, ...]
            new entity type2: [subtype1, subtype2, ...]

            ### new entity type definitions ###
            new entity type1: Clear and concise definition of the new entity type.
            new entity type2: Clear and concise definition of the new entity type.
