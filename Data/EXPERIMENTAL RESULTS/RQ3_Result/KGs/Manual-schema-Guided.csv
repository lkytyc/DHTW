You do so by calling the nextToken() method of the StreamTokenizer inside a loop.,[]
Before the first next() call the ResultSet is positioned before the first row.,[]
"Once the row is ready to be inserted into the ResultSet, call the insertRow() method.",[]
Here is an example of creating a JDBC DatabaseMetaData object via the JDBC Connection getMetaData() method:,[]
"If you need to insert another row, explicitly call moveToInsertRow() to signal this to the ResultSet.","[""('method', 'call', 'class'): (movetoinsertrow(), signal, resultset)""]"
The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses.,[]
The example I showed you above with the URLProcessorBase class is actually an example of the Template Method design pattern.,[]
The ResultSet returned by the getColumns() method contains a list of columns for the given table.,[]
"If a class has an abstract method, the whole class must be declared abstract.","[""('class', 'define', 'method'): (class, has, method)""]"
The Java Reader class has a method named skip() which can be used to skip over a number of characters in the input that you do not want to read.,[]
"System.in, System.out and System.err are initialized by the Java runtime when a Java VM starts up, so you don't have to instantiate any streams yourself (although you can exchange them at runtime).",[]
In the above example the subclass SmartClock has a method called getTimeInSeconds() which accesses the time variable of the superclass Clock.,"[""('class', 'extend', 'class'): (smartclock, subclass, clock)"", ""('class', 'contain', 'field'): (clock, variable, time)""]"
Now the isValid() method returns the value returned by the value.equals() method call.,[]
"Here is the same instanceof example, but using a Truck object instead of a Car object: Truck truck = new Truck(); Vehicle vehicle = truck; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; After executing this code the isCar will contain the value false.",[]
In many cases it would have made sense to place the getLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class where the licensePlate field is located.,"[""('class', 'contain', 'field'): (vehicle, contain, licenseplate)"", ""('class', 'define', 'field'): (vehicle, define, licenseplate)""]"
The updateLicensePlate() method sets the license plate value on the licensePlate field in the Car class.,"[""('class', 'contain', 'field'): (car, contain, licenseplate)""]"
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,[]
The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the fields in the class.,"[""('method', 'define', 'class'): (constructor, initialize, class)""]"

The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,[]
"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.","[""('class', 'contain', 'field'): (java interface, can only contain, fields)""]"
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",[]
You will normally use a Writer subclass rather than a Writer directly.,"[""('class', 'use', 'class'): (writer, use, writer)""]"
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.",[]
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,[]
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,[]
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.",[]
"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.",[]
"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.","[""('class', 'define', 'class'): (carproducer, set_generic_type, car)"", ""('method', 'return', 'class'): (produce(), return_type_equal_generic_type, car)""]"
The utility class is called Arrays and is located in the standard Java package java.util.,[]
This example module descriptor declares that it requires the standard Java module named javafx.graphics.,[]
Here is how you run the main class from a Java module JAR file:,[]
Now the result variable would end up with the value 12.5.,[]
Notice how you put new after the reference to the outer class in order to create an instance of the inner class.,[]
In Java nested classes are classes that are defined inside another class.,[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.",[]
The example above defines a method called writeText inside a class named MyClass.,[]
This would happen sometime at runtime - depending on when the application tried to use the missing class.,[]
"Instead of having a fixed number of layer packages which keep growing in number of classes, you get a growing number of application functionality packages with a smaller number of classes inside.",[]
A Java Record is a special kind of Java class which has a concise syntax for defining immutable data-only classes.,[]

"As you can see, a new StringBuilder is created, passing along the first String to its constructor, and the second String to its append() method, before finally calling the toString() method.",[]
You can search for substrings in Strings using the indexOf() method.,[]
Notice how the brandAsLowerCase() method calls the auto-generated brand() method internally.,[]
"If not, the default toString() method (inherited from the Object class) will get called.",[]
To write data to a Java FileOutputStream you can use its write() method.,[]
The second line assigns the floating point value 199.99 to the floating point variable named myFloat.,[]
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.","[""('method', 'return', 'class'): (produce(), return, object)""]"
The Java String class also has a lastIndexOf() method which finds the last occurrence of a substring.,[]
"The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too, except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle.",[]

You can obtain the parent Logger of a given Logger using the getParent() method.,[]
The int returned by the read() method tells how many bytes were written into the Buffer.,[]
The Java String class contains a method called trim() which can trim a string object.,[]
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method called translateEscapes() which can translate escape codes that exist inside a String in the same way the Java compiler translates them.,"[""('method', 'use', 'class'): (translateescapes(), escape codes, string)""]"
The Java NIO Files class also contains a function for moving files from one path to another.,[]

There is no guarantee of how many bytes the write() method writes to the FileChannel.,[]
You can obtain the current position of the FileChannel object by calling the position() method.,[]

"When the MyAction class calls methods on the IMyFactory instance injected into its constructor by the container, the method calls are translated into calls to the IContainer.instance() method, which is the method you use to obtain instances from the container.",[]

The call to the map() method of the Stream interface is a non-terminal operation.,[]
"Note: Even if the class is called RollingBufferInputStream, it is not an InputStream subclass.",[]
