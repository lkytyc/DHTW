The Collections reverse() method can reverse the elements in a Java List.,[]
Here is an example of finding the minimum element in a Java List using Collections min() method:,[]
"Notice too, that the compareTo() method should throw a NullPointerException if the parameter object is null.",[]
The LinkedList class is a pretty standard Deque and Queue implementation.,[]
You add elements to the beginning end of a Deque using the add() method.,[]
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the add() method will throw an exception.",[]
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the addLast() method will throw an exception.",[]
To peek at the last element of a Java Deque you can use the getLast() method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (deque, use the getlast() method, getlast())""]"
The remove() method removes the first element of a Java Deque.,[]

The Java Deque size() method returns the number of elements stored in the Java Deque at the time you invoke the method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (deque, returns the number of elements stored, size())""]"
"Because the Iterator has its generic type set to String, the Java compiler already knows that next() will return a String.",[]
"As you can see, a proper implementation of .equals() is essential for your own classes to work well with the Java Collection classes.",[]
"So, as you can see, a combination of the hashCode() and equals() methods are used when storing and when looking up objects in a hashtable.",[]
"Then it uses a for-each loop to iterate the elements of the List, and print out the toString() value of each element.",[]
Here is an example of iterating the elements of an Iterable via its forEach() method:,[]
"The reason the for-each loop is slower is, that each iteration will call the List iterator() method, which will create a new Iterator object.",[]
"In other words, if the Iterator has not yet iterated over all of the elements in the collection the Iterator was obtained from - the hasNext() method will return true.",[]
The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,[]
"The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter, so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter.",[]
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",[]
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.",[]
Since the Map does not contain any object stored by the key E the given default value will be returned - which is the String default value passed as the last parameter to the getOrDefault() method.,[]
"As you can see, the key Iterator returns every key stored in a Java Map, one by one (one for each call to next()).",[]
The number of entries in a Java Map is also referred to as the Map size - hence the method name size() .,[]
The isEmpty() method will return false if the Map instance contains 1 or more entries.,[]
Here is an example of creating an instance of the Java TreeMap class which implements the NavigableMap interface:,[]
"The tailMap variable will reference a SortedMap containing all key + value pairs from the NavigableMap for the keys ""c"", ""d"" and ""e"", as these keys are considered equal to or larger than the parameter value ""c"" passed to the tailMap() method.",[]
The lowerEntry() method in the NavigableMap interface returns the key + value pair for the highest key which is lower than the parameter value passed to the lowerEntry() method.,[]
"The pollFirstEntry() method returns and removes the ""first"" entry (key + value) in the NavigableMap or null if the map is empty.",[]
"The descendingIterator() method allows you to iterate the elements of the NavigableSet (which is also a SortedSet) in reverse order, without changing the order of the elements internally.",[]
"To get properties from a Java Properties object you use the getProperty() method, passing the key of the property to get as parameter.",[]
"Using the InputStream you can load the file into a Java Properties instance, using either the load() or loadFromXML() methods explained earlier in this Java Properties tutorial.","[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (inputstream, load the file into, properties)"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (properties, load, load())"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (properties, loadfromxml, loadfromxml())""]"
Here are two examples of taking an element from a Java Queue using its poll() and remove() methods:,"[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (poll(), taking an element, remove())""]"
You can check if a Java Queue contains a certain element via its contains() method.,[]
The Java Set interface as a method called removeAll() which removes all elements in the Set which are also present in another Collection.,[]
You can check the size of a Java Set using the size() method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (set, check the size using, size())""]"
"You iterate the keys of a SortedMap by calling its keySet() method, like this:",[]
The SortedMap interface has a method named headMap() which returns a new Map which contains the first elements of the SortedMap according to the sort order used.,[]
Here is an example of obtaining a submap from a Java SortedMap via its subMap() method:,[]
The Java Collections API only has one implementation of the Java SortedSet interface - the java.util.TreeSet class.,[]
"Additionally, the Vector class uses several older (no longer recommended) parts of Java, like the Enumeration which is superseded by the Iterator interface.",[]
You push elements onto a Java Stack using its push() method.,[]
Here is an example of obtaining the size of a Java Stack via its size() method:,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (stack, obtain size via, size())""]"
The lockWrite() method of a ReadWriteLock class shown below is an example of a test-and-set method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (readwritelock, method_of, lockwrite())""]"

"The easiest way to create a subclass of ThreadLocal is to simply create an anonymous subclass, right where you create the ThreadLocal variable.",[]
"Here is an example of creating a ThreadLocal using its withInitial() static factory method, passing a simple Supplier implementation as parameter:",[]
Notice how the format() method calls the getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat() method to obtain a Java SimpleDatFormat instance.,[]
"The Counter class could have been written like this instead, using a Lock instead of a synchronized block:",[]
"While isLocked is true, the thread calling lock() is parked waiting in the wait() call.","[""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (lock(), is parked waiting, wait())""]"
"When the thread is done with the code in the critical section (the code between lock() and unlock()), the thread calls unlock().",[]
"Otherwise, a single call to unlock() will unlock the lock, even if the lock has been locked multiple times.",[]
"That you would not call wait() and notify() on an internal monitor object, but rather on the This is probably true.",[]
This is how such exclusive access could look using a synchronized block in Java: public class SynchronizedCounter { long count = 0; public void inc() { synchronized(this) { count++; } } public long count() { synchronized(this) { return this.count; } } } Notice how the inc() and count() methods both contain a synchronized block.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (synchronizedcounter, method, inc())"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (synchronizedcounter, method, count())""]"

"If you look at the Synchronizer class above and look into this Lock implementation you will notice that threads are now blocked trying to access the lock() method, if more than one thread calls lock() simultanously.",[]
"The thread calling unlock() will take the top QueueObject in the queue and call doNotify() on it, to awaken the thread waiting on that object.",[]

In the following sections I will explain how to use the ReentrantLock class as a Lock.,[]
To unlock the Lock instance you must call its unlock() method.,[]
"To better understand how using a Lock looks different from using a synchronized block, I have created two simple concurrent Counter classes which protects their internal count in different ways.",[]

If you want to set a different offset for the dest byte array there is a version of update() and doFinal() which takes an offset parameter extra.,[]
Notice the call to update() and then doFinal() for these two blocks of data.,[]
To generate an asymmetric key pair you can use the KeyPairGenerator (java.security.KeyPairGenerator).,[]
You create a KeyGenerator instance by calling the static method getInstance() passing as parameter the name of the encryption algorithm to create a key for.,[]
Initializing a KeyGenerator instance is done by calling its init() method.,[]

In many cases it would have made sense to place the getLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class where the licensePlate field is located.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (vehicle, place the getlicenseplate() method, getlicenseplate())""]"
"Here is the same instanceof example, but using a Truck object instead of a Car object: Truck truck = new Truck(); Vehicle vehicle = truck; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; After executing this code the isCar will contain the value false.",[]
The updateLicensePlate() method sets the license plate value on the licensePlate field in the Car class.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (car, updatelicenseplate, updatelicenseplate())""]"
"The getLicensePlate() method, however, returns the value of the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class.",[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.",[]
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,[]
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.",[]
"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.",[]
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,[]
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",[]
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.","[""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (method, not possible if, default methods)""]"
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,[]
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,[]
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.",[]
"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.","[""('class', 'type_conversion', 'class'): (object, cast to, car)""]"
"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.",[]
Now the result variable would end up with the value 12.5.,[]
The example above defines a method called writeText inside a class named MyClass.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (myclass, defines a method called, writetext)""]"
This would happen sometime at runtime - depending on when the application tried to use the missing class.,[]
This example module descriptor declares that it requires the standard Java module named javafx.graphics.,[]
Here is how you run the main class from a Java module JAR file:,[]
In Java nested classes are classes that are defined inside another class.,[]
Notice how you put new after the reference to the outer class in order to create an instance of the inner class.,[]
"As you can see, an anonymous class implementing an interface is pretty similar to an anonymous class extending another class.",[]
"Users of the Cache class may never see the CacheEntry class, if they have no need to obtain information about the CacheEntry itself, but only the cached value.",[]
"If the classes A and B are located in the same Java package, there is no problem with the code above.",[]
"Instead of having a fixed number of layer packages which keep growing in number of classes, you get a growing number of application functionality packages with a smaller number of classes inside.","[""('package', 'contain', 'class'): (package, includes, classes)""]"
A Java Record is a special kind of Java class which has a concise syntax for defining immutable data-only classes.,[]
You can add instance methods to a Java Record definition - just like you can with a regular Java class.,[]
Notice how the brandAsLowerCase() method calls the auto-generated brand() method internally.,[]
"As you can see, a new StringBuilder is created, passing along the first String to its constructor, and the second String to its append() method, before finally calling the toString() method.","[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (stringbuilder, created and passed along, string)""]"
You can search for substrings in Strings using the indexOf() method.,[]
The Java String class also has a lastIndexOf() method which finds the last occurrence of a substring.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (string, has, lastindexof())""]"
The Java String class contains a method called trim() which can trim a string object.,[]
"If not, the default toString() method (inherited from the Object class) will get called.",[]
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method called translateEscapes() which can translate escape codes that exist inside a String in the same way the Java compiler translates them.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (string, got a new method called, translateescapes())""]"
When you create an instance of a class (an object) the object can have methods you can execute.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (class, create an instance of, method)""]"
The second line assigns the floating point value 199.99 to the floating point variable named myFloat.,[]
"When you click the ""Run..."" option, IntelliJ IDEA will first compile your Java class, and then run it.",[]
"The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too, except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle.","[""('method', 'function_similarity', 'method'): (logrb(), work like, log())""]"
You can obtain the parent Logger of a given Logger using the getParent() method.,[]
The getParameters() method returns the parameters to be inserted into the message of this LogRecord.,[]
The getResourceBundle() method returns the ResourceBundle (if any) used to localize the message of this LogRecord.,[]
"Note: This tutorial does not cover the other popular Java logging API's (Log4J, SLF4J, Apache Commons Logging, LogBack etc.).",[]
Receiving data via a DatagramSocket is done by first creating a DatagramPacket and then receiving data into it via the DatagramSocket's receive() method.,"[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (datagramsocket, involves the use of, datagrampacket)"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (datagramsocket, has method, receive())""]"
The java.net package contains two interesting classes: The URL class and the URLConnection class.,"[""('package', 'contain', 'class'): (java.net, contains, url)"", ""('package', 'contain', 'class'): (java.net, contains, urlconnection)""]"
You can check the when the read operation is finished by calling the isDone() method of the Future instance returned by the read() method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (future, method_of, isdone())"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (future, method_of, read())""]"
Each way to write data call one of the write() methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel.,[]
The int returned by the read() method tells how many bytes were written into the Buffer.,[]
There is no guarantee of how many bytes the write() method writes to the FileChannel.,[]
You can obtain the current position of the FileChannel object by calling the position() method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (filechannel, obtain the current position by calling, position())""]"
The Files.createDirectory() method creates a new directory from a Path instance.,[]
The Java NIO Files class also contains a function for moving files from one path to another.,[]
Here is a walkFileTree() that extends SimpleFileVisitor to look for a file named README.txt :,[]
"By walking through all directories and deleting all files (inside visitFile()) in each directory, and afterwards delete the directory itself (inside postVisitDirectory()) you can delete a directory with all subdirectories and files.",[]
"In many cases though, you can replace the use of the File class with use of the Path interface.",[]
The normalize() method of the Path interface can normalize a path.,[]
"As you saw in the previous section, when you register a Channel with a Selector the register() method returns a SelectionKey objects.","[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (channel, register_with, selector)""]"
"You can also attach an object already while registering the Channel with the Selector, in the register() method.",[]
NOTE: Only the interfaces specifically declared implemented by a given class is returned.,[]
All you need to do is to obtain a ClassLoader and call its loadClass() method.,[]
"When the MyAction class calls methods on the IMyFactory instance injected into its constructor by the container, the method calls are translated into calls to the IContainer.instance() method, which is the method you use to obtain instances from the container.",[]
"You cannot ask for getters and setters explicitly, so you will have to scan through all the methods of a class and check if each method is a getter or setter.","[""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (getters, scan through, method)"", ""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (setters, scan through, method)"", ""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (class, includes, method)""]"
To access a private field you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredField(String name) or Class.getDeclaredFields() method.,[]
"By calling Field.setAcessible(true) you turn off the access checks for this particular Field instance, for reflection only.",[]
"The methods Class.getMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) and Class.getMethods() methods only return public methods, so they won't work.","[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (class.getmethod, return public methods, class.getmethods)""]"
"It will explain the basics of Java Reflection including how to work with arrays, annotations, generics and dynamic proxies, and do dynamic class loading and reloading.",[]
"For instance, if you are introspecting a String array, you can detect that the element type is String by inspecting the array class.",[]
"For instance, the character class [a-zA-Z] will match all letters between a and z or between A and Z .",[]
"For that, you need to use the find(), start() and end() methods.",[]
"In other words, if the regular expression matches the beginning of a text but not the whole text, lookingAt() will return true, whereas matches() will return false.","[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), return true if matches beginning, matches())"", ""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (matches(), return false if not whole text, lookingat())""]"
"In case you have started matching occurrences in a string via the find() method, the Matcher will internally keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text.",[]
The Matcher replaceAll() and replaceFirst() methods can be used to replace parts of the string the Matcher is searching through.,"[""('method', 'function_replace', 'method'): (matcher.replaceall(), replace parts of the string, matcher.replacefirst())""]"
A regular expression is also sometimes referred to as a pattern (hence the name of the Java Pattern class).,[]
"Too keep this text short, the Matcher covered in more detail in the text about the Java Matcher class.",[]
When you are finished reading data from the GZIPInputStream you should close it using its close() method.,[]
"But, notice how no DI is used inside the BO.checkPersonIsValid() or the DAO.readPerson() methods.",[]
"This little script defines the ""max"" factory as a call to the static max() method with input parameter 0 and 1 passed to the max() method.",[]
"In other words, as a call to the get() method on the HttpRequestCache singleton.",[]
The ScriptFactoryBuilder has a addFactories() method that takes an InputStream as parameter instead of a String.,[]
"Notice how the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse are not obtained by the ThreadLocal.get() method, but via the static methods getRequest() and getResponse().",[]
"The IObjectMappingKey instance can contain more information about the class to be mapped, than a Class object can.",[]
This is the object is obtained from the getResult() method of the IResultSetProcessor.,[]
"This speeds up object mapping cache lookups because the hashCode() method returns this int id, and because equals() also only compares int id's, instead of Class objects, table names etc.",[]
The extended class CustomObjectMapperBase is an empty implementation of the ICustomObjectMapper interface.,[]
Just call the IObjectMapping.removeGetterMapping(String name) or IObjectMapping.removeSetterMapping(String name) method to do so.,[]
"Second, you do not need the parentheses around the closure when calling doFirst() or doLast().",[]
The and() method is used to combine two other Predicate functions in the same way I showed in the beginning of this Java functional composition tutorial.,[]
"The Java Function compose() method composes a new Function instance from the Function instance it is called on, and the Function instance passed as parameter to the compose() method.",[]
The first example of a higher order function is the Collections.sort() method which takes a Comparator as parameter.,[]
The call to the map() method of the Stream interface is a non-terminal operation.,[]
Only the first occurrence of this element will be included in the Stream returned by distinct().,[]
"The findFirst() method returns an Optional from which you can obtain the element, if present.",[]
"The Java Stream forEach() method is a terminal operation which starts the internal iteration of the elements in the Stream, and applies a Consumer (java.util.function.Consumer) to each element in the Stream.",[]
Which element is the largest is determined by the Comparator implementation you pass to the max() method.,[]
This Optional contains the value (if any) returned by the lambda expression passed to the reduce() method.,[]
"Note: Even if the class is called RollingBufferInputStream, it is not an InputStream subclass.",[]
"You can specify fonts for most text objects (Chunk, Phrase, Paragraph etc.)",[]

"Here is an implementation of the ring buffer that uses a read position and flip marker, including the batch put() and take() operations.",[]
"If your benchmark method produces multiple results you can pass each of these results to a black hole, meaning calling consume() on the Blackhole instance for each value.",[]
The javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class is a slightly more advanced base class than the GenericServlet shown in the Simple Servlet example.,[]
The easiest way to implement this interface is to extend either the class GenericServlet or HttpServlet.,[]
Each test method usually tests a single method of the target class.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (class, tests, method)""]"
"A protected method or field, on the other hand, is also accessible to other classes in the same package, and for subclasses of the unit too.",[]

Here is the unit test which uses a ByteArrayOutputStream to collect the data written to the OutputStream passed to the MyIOUnit.write() method:,"[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (bytearrayoutputstream, collect the data written to, outputstream)""]"
You may also be able to use the StringReader and StringWriter classes in your unit tests.,"[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (stringreader, use, stringwriter)""]"
"To avoid fragmenting the Java heap with Bytes instances, the Bytes class is designed to be obtained from an ObjectPool .",[]
To defragment the free blocks you call the defragment() method of the BytesAllocatorManualDefrag .,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (bytesallocatormanualdefrag, defragment() method, defragment())""]"
The Bytes class represents a byte sequence allocated from a shared byte array.,[]

The easiest way to create an instance of the RionObjectReader is via the RionObjectReaderBuilder class.,"[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (rionobjectreader, create an instance via, rionobjectreaderbuilder)""]"
The RionObjectReader readCyclic() method reads a cyclic object graph stored as RION in a byte array.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (rionobjectreader, readcyclic() method, readcyclic())""]"
The RionObjectWriter writeAcyclic() can write an acyclic object graph as RION into a byte array.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (rionobjectwriter, writeacyclic, writeacyclic())""]"
When reading a composite RION field you need to use the RionReader moveInto() and moveOutOf() methods.,[]
"Here are two examples of writing a 32 bit and 64 bit floating point number as RION Float fields to the destination byte array, using the RionWriter writeFloat32() and writeFloat64() methods:",[]
The StreamStorageFS class contains a method to read bytes from a stream block file.,[]

You can always obtain the root directory path a StreamStorageRootFS was created with via its getRootDirPath() method.,"[""('class', 'has_method', 'method'): (streamstoragerootfs, obtain the root directory path via, getrootdirpath())""]"
"When you write records to a stream via the StreamStorageFS instance, the StreamStorageFS class will divide the records into multiple files.",[]
You can read the data stored in a Buffer using the many get...() methods.,[]
Notice the use of / as directory separator and the use of : as classpath entry separator.,[]
"However, if you do need to access the body of the HTTP response, you need to register another handler on the HttpClientResponse that is passed as parameter to the first Handler's handle() method.",[]
"Again, the NetClient's close() method is asynchronous, so the underlying TCP connection may not yet be closed by the time the close() method returns.",[]
Sending messages via the event bus can be done via either the send() or publish() method on the event bus.,[]
A verticle has a start() and a stop() method which are called when the verticle is deployed and when it is undeployed.,[]
The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter,[]
But no thread can actually execute unlock() until the thread waiting in lock() leaves the outer synchronized block,"[""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (unlock(), execute after, lock())""]"

Adding and getting elements to a generic Map is done using the put() and get() methods just like you have always done,[]
Deque.pollLast() is different than removeLast() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (deque.polllast(), is different than, deque.removelast())""]"
The tailSet() method works the same way as the headSet() method except it returns all elements that are equal to or higher than the given parameter element,"[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (tailset(), works the same way as, headset())""]"
"You can also obtain an Iterator from many of the Java Collection data structures, e.g. a List, Set, Map, Queue, Deque or Map.",[]
java.io.Writer works just like combining the Reader with InputStream or the Writer with OutputStream,[]
Remember that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances,[]
The bigger the result String grows the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method,[]
The logp() methods work like the log() methods except each method take an extra two parameters The sourceClass and sourceMethod parameter,"[""('method', 'behavior_difference', 'method'): (logp(), work like, log())""]"

You can convert a Java Set to a Java List by creating a List and calling its addAll() method passing the Set as parameter to the addAll() method,"[""('class', 'type_conversion', 'class'): (set, convert_to, list)""]"
Even though the Java Networking APIs enable you to open and close network connections via sockets all communication happens via the Java IO classes InputStream and OutputStream,"[""('class', 'function_collaboration', 'class'): (inputstream, communication happens via, outputstream)""]"
Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,[]
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"[""('method', 'logic_constraint', 'method'): (contains(), does not use equals() method, equals())""]"
Both Java File and FileChannel works but in case you want a pure Java NIO solution use the Java NIO FileChannel class,[]
