The RionObjectWriter writeAcyclic() can write an acyclic object graph as RION into a byte array.,"[""('class', 'method', 'method'): (rionobjectwriter, write, writeacyclic())""]"
When reading a composite RION field you need to use the RionReader moveInto() and moveOutOf() methods.,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (moveinto(), use, moveoutof())""]"
"Here are two examples of writing a 32 bit and 64 bit floating point number as RION Float fields to the destination byte array, using the RionWriter writeFloat32() and writeFloat64() methods:","[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (writefloat32(), utilizes, writefloat64())""]"
The StreamStorageFS class contains a method to read bytes from a stream block file.,"[""('class', 'method', 'method'): (streamstoragefs, contains a method to, read)""]"
"The readBytes() method reads bytes from the file represented by the given StreamStorageBlockFS instance, into the byte[] array passed as parameter.",[]
You can always obtain the root directory path a StreamStorageRootFS was created with via its getRootDirPath() method.,"[""('class', 'method', 'method'): (streamstoragerootfs, obtain the root directory path via, getrootdirpath())""]"
"When you write records to a stream via the StreamStorageFS instance, the StreamStorageFS class will divide the records into multiple files.",[]
You can read the data stored in a Buffer using the many get...() methods.,"[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (buffer, stored in, get...())""]"
Notice the use of / as directory separator and the use of : as classpath entry separator.,[]
"However, if you do need to access the body of the HTTP response, you need to register another handler on the HttpClientResponse that is passed as parameter to the first Handler's handle() method.","[""('class', 'method', 'method'): (httpclientresponse, register another handler on, handle())""]"
"Again, the NetClient's close() method is asynchronous, so the underlying TCP connection may not yet be closed by the time the close() method returns.",[]
Sending messages via the event bus can be done via either the send() or publish() method on the event bus.,"[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (send(), can be done via, publish())""]"
A verticle has a start() and a stop() method which are called when the verticle is deployed and when it is undeployed.,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (start(), called when the verticle is deployed, stop())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (stop(), called when the verticle is undeployed, start())""]"
The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter,"[""('method', 'method', 'interface'): (addall(), takes as parameter, collection)"", ""('method', 'method', 'interface'): (addall(), takes as parameter, list)"", ""('method', 'method', 'interface'): (addall(), takes as parameter, set)""]"
But no thread can actually execute unlock() until the thread waiting in lock() leaves the outer synchronized block,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (unlock(), execute after, lock())""]"
A thread cannot call wait() notify() or notifyAll() without holding the lock on the object the method is called on,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (wait(), requires_lock, notify())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (wait(), requires_lock, notifyall())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (notify(), requires_lock, notifyall())""]"
"The Arrays class contains a set of methods called binarySearch(). This method helps you perform a binary search in an array. The array must first be sorted.

java.lang.ThreadLocal is possible to set an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal which will get used the first time get() is called before set() has been called with a new value,"[""('class', 'method', 'method'): (java.lang.threadlocal, set an initial value, get())"", ""('class', 'method', 'method'): (java.lang.threadlocal, set an initial value, set())""]"
Adding and getting elements to a generic Map is done using the put() and get() methods just like you have always done,[]
Deque.pollLast() is different than removeLast() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (deque.polllast(), is different than, removelast())""]"
The tailSet() method works the same way as the headSet() method except it returns all elements that are equal to or higher than the given parameter element,"[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (tailset(), works the same way as, headset())""]"
"You can also obtain an Iterator from many of the Java Collection data structures, e.g. a List, Set, Map, Queue, Deque or Map.","[""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, list)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, set)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, map)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, queue)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, deque)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (iterator, obtain from, map)""]"
java.io.Writer works just like combining the Reader with InputStream or the Writer with OutputStream,"[""('class', 'equivalence', 'class'): (java.io.writer, works just like combining, java.io.reader)"", ""('class', 'equivalence', 'class'): (java.io.writer, works just like combining, java.io.inputstream)"", ""('class', 'equivalence', 'class'): (java.io.writer, works just like combining, java.io.outputstream)""]"
Remember that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (wait(), call, notify())""]"
The bigger the result String grows the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method,"[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (string, copy the characters from, stringbuilder)""]"
The logp() methods work like the log() methods except each method take an extra two parameters The sourceClass and sourceMethod parameter,"[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (logp(), work like, log())""]"
But since the thread waiting in lock() has not yet called queueObject.wait() the call to queueObject.notify() passes into oblivion,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (lock(), waiting, wait())"", ""('method', 'cancellation', 'method'): (notify(), passes into oblivion, wait())""]"
Since PipedOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream PipedOutputStream has the same basic methods and use patterns as an OutputStream,"[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (pipedoutputstream, is a subclass of, outputstream)""]"
You can convert a Java Set to a Java List by creating a List and calling its addAll() method passing the Set as parameter to the addAll() method,"[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (set, convert to, list)"", ""('class', 'method', 'method'): (set, parameter to, addall())"", ""('class', 'method', 'method'): (list, calling, addall())""]"

Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,[]
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (contains(), use, equals())""]"
Both Java File and FileChannel works but in case you want a pure Java NIO solution use the Java NIO FileChannel class,"[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (file, works but in case you want a pure java nio solution use, filechannel)""]"
If you need an integer value use the round() floor() or ceil() method,"[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (round(), use, floor())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (round(), use, ceil())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (floor(), or, ceil())""]"
The poll() and remove() both removes the first element in the Queue. They differ in how they behave if the Queue is empty. The poll() method returns null if the Queue is empty. The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (poll(), behavior if the queue is empty, remove())"", ""('method', 'method', 'class'): (poll(), removes the first element, queue)"", ""('method', 'method', 'class'): (remove(), removes the first element, queue)""]"
"The add() and offer() methods differ in how the behave if the Queue is full, so no more elements can be added. The add() method throws an exception in that case, whereas the offer() method just returns false.","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (add(), differ in behavior, offer())""]"
Each of the methods ceilingEntry() floorEntry() higherEntry() and lowerEntry() will be covered in the following sections,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (ceilingentry(), covered in the following sections, floorentry())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (ceilingentry(), covered in the following sections, higherentry())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (ceilingentry(), covered in the following sections, lowerentry())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (floorentry(), covered in the following sections, higherentry())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (floorentry(), covered in the following sections, lowerentry())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (higherentry(), covered in the following sections, lowerentry())""]"
To do so set the upper bound to 1 and have the call to take() and release() guard the critical section,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (take(), guard the critical section, release())""]"
Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though you read and write data to and from it via Java IO InputStream and OutputStream classes,"[""('class', 'association', 'class'): (inputstream, read data from, outputstream)"", ""('class', 'association', 'class'): (outputstream, write data to, inputstream)""]"
Many of the core components in the Java Collection API rely on the correct implementation of the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (hashcode(), rely on, equals())""]"
java.io.PrintWriter example first creates a PrintWriter instance which is connected to a FileWriter,[]
InputStream.read() example creates an AsynchronousFileChannel and then creates a ByteBuffer which is passed to the read() method as parameter along with a position of 0,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (inputstream.read(), passed to, read())"", ""('method', 'containment', 'class'): (inputstream.read(), passed to, bytebuffer)""]"
java.lang.StringBuffer text explains how to use the SimpleDateFormat class to format dates,[]
In general you can call the markSupported() method to find out if mark() and reset() are supported on a given InputStream or not but the BufferedInputStream supports them,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (marksupported(), find out if supported, mark())"", ""('method', 'method', 'method'): (marksupported(), find out if supported, reset())"", ""('method', 'method', 'class'): (marksupported(), find out if supported, inputstream)"", ""('method', 'method', 'class'): (marksupported(), find out if supported, bufferedinputstream)"", ""('class', 'method', 'method'): (bufferedinputstream, supports, mark())"", ""('class', 'method', 'method'): (bufferedinputstream, supports, reset())""]"
"The newLine() method which can write a new-line character to the underlying Writer. In addition, you may need to call flush() if you need to be absolutely sure that the characters written until now is flushed out of the buffer and onto the network or disk.","[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (newline(), write a new-line character, flush())""]"
Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (queue.poll(), is different than, remove())""]"
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,"[""('method', 'method', 'method'): (set(), synchronized block, get())""]"
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted. This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (replace(), insert conditionally, put())"", ""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (put(), insert unconditionally, replace())""]"
The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle,"[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (logrb(), work like, log())""]"
The Handler in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord before writing it to an external system,"[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.handler, use, java.util.logging.formatter)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.handler, format, java.util.logging.logrecord)""]"
