Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the FileWriter instance.,,[]
The Java InputStream class contains a method called readAllBytes() (since Java 9).,,[]
Here is an example of reading all bytes from a Java InputStream via readAllBytes():,,[]
"If an InputStream subclass supports the mark() and reset() methods, then that subclass should override the markSupported() to return true.",,[]
The read() method of an InputStreamReader returns an int which contains the char value of the char read.,,[]
Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the CharArrayWriter instance.,,[]

Closing a Java StringReader can be done using the close() method like this:,,[]
The Java OutputStream's flush() method flushes all data written to the OutputStream to the underlying data destination.,,[]
The Java OutputStreamWriter's flush() method flushes all data written to the OutputStreamWriter to the underlying data destination.,,[]
"If you push back multiple bytes into the PushbackInputStream, the latest byte pushed back will be returned first from read(), just like on a stack.",,[]
"You read bytes from the Java PushbackInputStream via its read() method, just like you do from a regular InputStream .",,[]
"Remember, calling this write() method will advance the file position of the RandomAccessFile by 1.",,[]
The Java Reader class has a method named skip() which can be used to skip over a number of characters in the input that you do not want to read.,,[]
You do so by calling the nextToken() method of the StreamTokenizer inside a loop.,,[]
"System.in, System.out and System.err are initialized by the Java runtime when a Java VM starts up, so you don't have to instantiate any streams yourself (although you can exchange them at runtime).",,[]
You will normally use a Writer subclass rather than a Writer directly.,,[]

The utility class is called Arrays and is located in the standard Java package java.util.,,[]
The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the fields in the class.,,[]
Now the isValid() method returns the value returned by the value.equals() method call.,,[]
In many cases it would have made sense to place the getLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class where the licensePlate field is located.,,[]
"Here is the same instanceof example, but using a Truck object instead of a Car object: Truck truck = new Truck(); Vehicle vehicle = truck; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; After executing this code the isCar will contain the value false.",,[]
The updateLicensePlate() method sets the license plate value on the licensePlate field in the Car class.,,[]
"The getLicensePlate() method, however, returns the value of the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class.",,[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.",,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,,[]
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.",,[]
"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.",,[]
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,,[]
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",,[]
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.",,[]
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,,[]
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,,[]
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.",,[]
"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.",,[]
"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.",,[]
Now the result variable would end up with the value 12.5.,,[]
The example above defines a method called writeText inside a class named MyClass.,,[]
This would happen sometime at runtime - depending on when the application tried to use the missing class.,,[]
This example module descriptor declares that it requires the standard Java module named javafx.graphics.,,[]

You can check the when the read operation is finished by calling the isDone() method of the Future instance returned by the read() method.,,[]
Each way to write data call one of the write() methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel.,,[]
The int returned by the read() method tells how many bytes were written into the Buffer.,,[]
There is no guarantee of how many bytes the write() method writes to the FileChannel.,,[]
You can obtain the current position of the FileChannel object by calling the position() method.,,[]
The Files.createDirectory() method creates a new directory from a Path instance.,,[]
The Java NIO Files class also contains a function for moving files from one path to another.,,[]
Here is a walkFileTree() that extends SimpleFileVisitor to look for a file named README.txt :,,[]
"By walking through all directories and deleting all files (inside visitFile()) in each directory, and afterwards delete the directory itself (inside postVisitDirectory()) you can delete a directory with all subdirectories and files.",,[]
"In many cases though, you can replace the use of the File class with use of the Path interface.",,[]
The normalize() method of the Path interface can normalize a path.,,[]
"As you saw in the previous section, when you register a Channel with a Selector the register() method returns a SelectionKey objects.",,[]

All you need to do is to obtain a ClassLoader and call its loadClass() method.,,[]
"When the MyAction class calls methods on the IMyFactory instance injected into its constructor by the container, the method calls are translated into calls to the IContainer.instance() method, which is the method you use to obtain instances from the container.",,[]
"You cannot ask for getters and setters explicitly, so you will have to scan through all the methods of a class and check if each method is a getter or setter.",,[]
To access a private field you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredField(String name) or Class.getDeclaredFields() method.,,[]
"By calling Field.setAcessible(true) you turn off the access checks for this particular Field instance, for reflection only.",,[]
"The methods Class.getMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) and Class.getMethods() methods only return public methods, so they won't work.",,[]
"It will explain the basics of Java Reflection including how to work with arrays, annotations, generics and dynamic proxies, and do dynamic class loading and reloading.",,[]
"For instance, if you are introspecting a String array, you can detect that the element type is String by inspecting the array class.",,[]
"For instance, the character class [a-zA-Z] will match all letters between a and z or between A and Z .",,[]
"For that, you need to use the find(), start() and end() methods.",,[]
"In other words, if the regular expression matches the beginning of a text but not the whole text, lookingAt() will return true, whereas matches() will return false.",,[]
"In case you have started matching occurrences in a string via the find() method, the Matcher will internally keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text.",,[]
The Matcher replaceAll() and replaceFirst() methods can be used to replace parts of the string the Matcher is searching through.,,[]
A regular expression is also sometimes referred to as a pattern (hence the name of the Java Pattern class).,,[]

Since PipedOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream PipedOutputStream has the same basic methods and use patterns as an OutputStream,"['implementation: (pipedoutputstream, is a subclass of, outputstream)']",[]
You can convert a Java Set to a Java List by creating a List and calling its addAll() method passing the Set as parameter to the addAll() method,"['conversion: (set, convert, list)', 'dependency: (set, parameter, addall())', 'dependency: (list, addall(), addall())']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (set, convert, list)""]"
Even though the Java Networking APIs enable you to open and close network connections via sockets all communication happens via the Java IO classes InputStream and OutputStream,"['containment: (networking, enable via, socket)', 'dependency: (networking, happens via, inputstream)', 'dependency: (networking, happens via, outputstream)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (networking, enable via, socket)""]"
Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,"['implementation: (first(), return, next())']",[]
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"['dependency: (contains(), use, equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (contains(), use, equals())""]"
Both Java File and FileChannel works but in case you want a pure Java NIO solution use the Java NIO FileChannel class,"['preference: (java file, preference, java nio filechannel)', 'comparison: (java file, comparison, filechannel)', 'comparison: (filechannel, comparison, java nio filechannel)', 'implementation: (java nio, implementation, java nio filechannel)']","[""('class', 'preference', 'class'): (java file, preference, java nio filechannel)"", ""('class', 'comparison', 'class'): (java file, comparison, filechannel)"", ""('class', 'comparison', 'class'): (filechannel, comparison, java nio filechannel)""]"
If you need an integer value use the round() floor() or ceil() method,"['comparison: (round(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, floor())', 'comparison: (round(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, ceil())', 'comparison: (floor(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, ceil())']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (round(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, floor())"", ""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (round(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, ceil())"", ""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (floor(), evaluate or contrast characteristics, ceil())""]"
The poll() and remove() both removes the first element in the Queue. They differ in how they behave if the Queue is empty. The poll() method returns null if the Queue is empty. The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"['comparison: (poll(), behavior_if_empty, remove())']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (poll(), behavior_if_empty, remove())""]"
"The add() and offer() methods differ in how the behave if the Queue is full, so no more elements can be added. The add() method throws an exception in that case, whereas the offer() method just returns false.","['comparison: (add(), throws an exception if full, offer())', 'containment: (add(), methods in, queue)', 'containment: (offer(), methods in, queue)']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (add(), throws an exception if full, offer())"", ""('method', 'containment', 'class'): (add(), methods in, queue)"", ""('method', 'containment', 'class'): (offer(), methods in, queue)""]"
Each of the methods ceilingEntry() floorEntry() higherEntry() and lowerEntry() will be covered in the following sections,"['implementation: (ceilingentry(), will be covered in the following sections, floorentry())', 'implementation: (ceilingentry(), will be covered in the following sections, higherentry())', 'implementation: (ceilingentry(), will be covered in the following sections, lowerentry())', 'implementation: (floorentry(), will be covered in the following sections, higherentry())', 'implementation: (floorentry(), will be covered in the following sections, lowerentry())', 'implementation: (higherentry(), will be covered in the following sections, lowerentry())']",[]
To do so set the upper bound to 1 and have the call to take() and release() guard the critical section,"['dependency: (take(), guard the critical section, release())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (take(), guard the critical section, release())""]"
Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though you read and write data to and from it via Java IO InputStream and OutputStream classes,"['dependency: (inputstream, read from, outputstream)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (inputstream, read from, outputstream)""]"
Many of the core components in the Java Collection API rely on the correct implementation of the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.,"['containment: (java collection api, rely on the correct implementation of, hashcode())', 'containment: (java collection api, rely on the correct implementation of, equals())']","[""('package', 'containment', 'method'): (java collection api, rely on the correct implementation of, hashcode())"", ""('package', 'containment', 'method'): (java collection api, rely on the correct implementation of, equals())""]"
java.io.PrintWriter example first creates a PrintWriter instance which is connected to a FileWriter,"['creation: (java.io.printwriter, creates, java.io.filewriter)', 'containment: (java.io.printwriter, is connected to, java.io.filewriter)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java.io.printwriter, is connected to, java.io.filewriter)""]"
InputStream.read() example creates an AsynchronousFileChannel and then creates a ByteBuffer which is passed to the read() method as parameter along with a position of 0,"['creation: (inputstream.read(), creates, asynchronousfilechannel)', 'creation: (inputstream.read(), creates, bytebuffer)', 'containment: (asynchronousfilechannel, inclusion, bytebuffer)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (inputstream.read(), creates, asynchronousfilechannel)"", ""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (inputstream.read(), creates, bytebuffer)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (asynchronousfilechannel, inclusion, bytebuffer)""]"
java.lang.StringBuffer text explains how to use the SimpleDateFormat class to format dates,"['implementation: (java.lang.stringbuffer, use, simpledateformat)']",[]
In general you can call the markSupported() method to find out if mark() and reset() are supported on a given InputStream or not but the BufferedInputStream supports them,"['accessibility: (marksupported(), access, mark())', 'accessibility: (marksupported(), access, reset())', 'implementation: (marksupported(), support, bufferedinputstream)', 'dependency: (marksupported(), find out if, inputstream)', 'dependency: (mark(), support, reset())', 'implementation: (mark(), support, bufferedinputstream)', 'dependency: (mark(), access, inputstream)', 'implementation: (reset(), support, bufferedinputstream)', 'dependency: (reset(), access, inputstream)']","[""('method', 'accessibility', 'method'): (marksupported(), access, mark())"", ""('method', 'accessibility', 'method'): (marksupported(), access, reset())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (mark(), support, reset())""]"
"The newLine() method which can write a new-line character to the underlying Writer. In addition, you may need to call flush() if you need to be absolutely sure that the characters written until now is flushed out of the buffer and onto the network or disk.","['implementation: (newline(), write, writer)', 'dependency: (flush(), ensure_flush_out_of_buffer, writer)']",[]
Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"['comparison: (queue.poll(), is different than, remove())', 'comparison: (remove(), throws an exception if, deque)']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (queue.poll(), is different than, remove())""]"
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,"['containment: (set(), contains_synchronized_blocks, get())']",[]
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted. This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.","['comparison: (replace(), different from how, put())']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (replace(), different from how, put())""]"
The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle,"['comparison: (logrb(), similarity, log())']","[""('method', 'comparison', 'method'): (logrb(), similarity, log())""]"
The Handler in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord before writing it to an external system,"['containment: (handler, use a, java.util.logging.formatter)', 'containment: (handler, format the, logrecord)', 'containment: (java.util.logging.formatter, format the, logrecord)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (handler, use a, java.util.logging.formatter)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (handler, format the, logrecord)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java.util.logging.formatter, format the, logrecord)""]"
