java.io.Writer works just like combining the Reader with InputStream or the Writer with OutputStream,[]
Remember that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances,"[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (wait(), call, mywaitnotify)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (notify(), call, mywaitnotify)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (wait(), mywaitnotify, notify())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (notify(), mywaitnotify, wait())""]"
The bigger the result String grows the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method,[]
The logp() methods work like the log() methods except each method take an extra two parameters The sourceClass and sourceMethod parameter,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (logp(), relies on, log())""]"
But since the thread waiting in lock() has not yet called queueObject.wait() the call to queueObject.notify() passes into oblivion,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (lock(), wait(), notify())""]"
Since PipedOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream PipedOutputStream has the same basic methods and use patterns as an OutputStream,"[""('class', 'implementation', 'class'): (pipedoutputstream, has the same basic methods and use patterns as, outputstream)""]"
You can convert a Java Set to a Java List by creating a List and calling its addAll() method passing the Set as parameter to the addAll() method,"[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (list, create, list)""]"

Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (first(), return, next())""]"
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (contains(), relies on, equals())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (contains(), relies on, ==)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (equals(), expresses equality, ==)""]"

The poll() and remove() both removes the first element in the Queue. They differ in how they behave if the Queue is empty. The poll() method returns null if the Queue is empty. The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (poll(), returns null if empty, remove())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (remove(), throws an exception if empty, poll())""]"

Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,[]
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (set(), relies on, get())""]"
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted.
