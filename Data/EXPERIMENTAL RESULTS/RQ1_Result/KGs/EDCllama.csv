Sending messages via the event bus can be done via either the send() or publish() method on the event bus.,"(""event bus"", ""has method"", ""send()""); (""event bus"", ""has method"", ""publish()"")"
A verticle has a start() and a stop() method which are called when the verticle is deployed and when it is undeployed.,"(""Verticle"", ""has"", ""start()""); (""Verticle"", ""has"", ""stop()""); (""Verticle"", ""is deployed by"", ""start()""); (""Verticle"", ""is undeployed by"", ""stop()"")"
The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter,"(""addAll()"", ""takes"", ""Collection""); (""addAll()"", ""takes"", ""List""); (""addAll()"", ""takes"", ""Java Set"")"
But no thread can actually execute unlock() until the thread waiting in lock() leaves the outer synchronized block,"(""Thread"", ""execute"", ""unlock()""); (""Thread"", ""waiting in"", ""lock()""); (""Thread"", ""leaves"", ""synchronized block""); (""lock()"", ""called by"", ""Thread""); (""unlock()"", ""called by"", ""Thread"")"

"The Arrays class contains a set of methods called binarySearch(). This method helps you perform a binary search in an array. The array must first be sorted. You can do so yourself, or via the Arrays.sort() method covered earlier in this text.",
java.lang.ThreadLocal is possible to set an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal which will get used the first time get() is called before set() has been called with a new value,"(""Java ThreadLocal"", ""has method"", ""get()""); (""Java ThreadLocal"", ""has method"", ""set()""); (""ThreadLocal"", ""is part of"", ""java.lang"")"
Adding and getting elements to a generic Map is done using the put() and get() methods just like you have always done,"(""Map"", ""uses"", ""put()""); (""Map"", ""uses"", ""get()"")"
Deque.pollLast() is different than removeLast() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"(""Deque"", ""hasMethod"", ""pollLast()""); (""Deque"", ""hasMethod"", ""removeLast()""); (""removeLast()"", ""throwsExceptionWhen"", ""Deque.isEmpty""); (""Deque"", ""hasState"", ""isEmpty"")"

Remember that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances,"(""MyWaitNotify"", ""has method"", ""wait()""); (""MyWaitNotify"", ""has method"", ""notify()""); (""MyWaitNotify"", ""stores signals from"", ""doWait()""); (""MyWaitNotify"", ""stores signals from"", ""doNotify()""); (""doWait()"", ""calls"", ""wait()""); (""doNotify()"", ""calls"", ""notify()""); (""thread"", ""calls"", ""wait()""); (""thread"", ""calls"", ""notify()"")"
The bigger the result String grows the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method,"(""String"", ""grows"", ""result String""); (""StringBuilder"", ""copy"", ""characters""); (""StringBuilder"", ""copy"", ""temporary String""); (""temporary String"", ""created by"", ""toString()""); (""String"", ""copy"", ""characters"")"
The logp() methods work like the log() methods except each method take an extra two parameters The sourceClass and sourceMethod parameter,"(""logp()"", ""is similar to"", ""log()""); (""logp()"", ""takes extra parameters"", ""sourceClass""); (""logp()"", ""takes extra parameters"", ""sourceMethod""); (""log()"", ""has variation"", ""logp()"")"
But since the thread waiting in lock() has not yet called queueObject.wait() the call to queueObject.notify() passes into oblivion,"(""lock"", ""has"", ""queueObject""); (""queueObject"", ""wait"", ""thread""); (""queueObject"", ""notify"", ""oblivion""); (""lock"", ""called by"", ""thread""); (""queueObject.wait"", ""not called by"", ""thread""); (""queueObject.notify"", ""called by"", ""unknown"")"
Since PipedOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream PipedOutputStream has the same basic methods and use patterns as an OutputStream,"(""PipedOutputStream"", ""is a subclass of"", ""OutputStream""); (""PipedOutputStream"", ""has methods"", ""OutputStream""); (""OutputStream"", ""has methods"", ""PipedOutputStream"")"
You can convert a Java Set to a Java List by creating a List and calling its addAll() method passing the Set as parameter to the addAll() method,"(""Java Set"", ""converted to"", ""Java List""); (""Java List"", ""has method"", ""addAll()""); (""addAll()"", ""takes parameter"", ""Java Set"")"
Even though the Java Networking APIs enable you to open and close network connections via sockets all communication happens via the Java IO classes InputStream and OutputStream,"(""Java Networking APIs"", ""enable"", ""network connections""); (""Java Networking APIs"", ""use"", ""sockets""); (""Java IO classes"", ""include"", ""InputStream""); (""Java IO classes"", ""include"", ""OutputStream""); (""InputStream"", ""handle"", ""communication""); (""OutputStream"", ""handle"", ""communication""); (""sockets"", ""establish"", ""network connections"")"
Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,"(""first()"", ""returns"", ""unicode index""); (""next()"", ""returns"", ""unicode index""); (""first()"", ""is part of"", ""word boundary""); (""next()"", ""is part of"", ""word boundary"")"
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"(""contains()"", ""uses"", ""equals()""); (""equals()"", ""compared by"", ""contains()""); (""contains()"", ""compares using"", ""== operator"")"
Both Java File and FileChannel works but in case you want a pure Java NIO solution use the Java NIO FileChannel class,"(""Java File"", ""works with"", ""FileChannel""); (""Java NIO"", ""provides"", ""FileChannel class""); (""FileChannel"", ""is part of"", ""Java NIO"")"
If you need an integer value use the round() floor() or ceil() method,"(""round()"", ""is_a"", ""method""); (""floor()"", ""is_a"", ""method""); (""ceil()"", ""is_a"", ""method"")"
The poll() and remove() both removes the first element in the Queue. They differ in how they behave if the Queue is empty. The poll() method returns null if the Queue is empty. The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"(""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""poll()""); (""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""remove()""); (""poll()"", ""returns"", ""null""); (""remove()"", ""throws"", ""exception""); (""Queue"", ""contains"", ""element"")"
"The add() and offer() methods differ in how the behave if the Queue is full, so no more elements can be added. The add() method throws an exception in that case, whereas the offer() method just returns false.",
Each of the methods ceilingEntry() floorEntry() higherEntry() and lowerEntry() will be covered in the following sections,"(""ceilingEntry()"", ""isMethodOf"", ""unknown""); (""floorEntry()"", ""isMethodOf"", ""unknown""); (""higherEntry()"", ""isMethodOf"", ""unknown""); (""lowerEntry()"", ""isMethodOf"", ""unknown"")"
To do so set the upper bound to 1 and have the call to take() and release() guard the critical section,"(""call"", ""has method"", ""take()""); (""call"", ""has method"", ""release()"")"
Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though you read and write data to and from it via Java IO InputStream and OutputStream classes,"(""Java IO"", ""contains"", ""InputStream""); (""Java IO"", ""contains"", ""OutputStream""); (""InputStream"", ""used for"", ""reading data""); (""OutputStream"", ""used for"", ""writing data""); (""socket"", ""uses"", ""InputStream""); (""socket"", ""uses"", ""OutputStream"")"
Many of the core components in the Java Collection API rely on the correct implementation of the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.,"(""Java Collection API"", ""rely on"", ""hashCode()""); (""Java Collection API"", ""rely on"", ""equals()""); (""hashCode()"", ""implemented in"", ""Java Collection API""); (""equals()"", ""implemented in"", ""Java Collection API"")"

In general you can call the markSupported() method to find out if mark() and reset() are supported on a given InputStream or not but the BufferedInputStream supports them,"(""InputStream"", ""has methods"", ""mark()""); (""InputStream"", ""has methods"", ""reset()""); (""BufferedInputStream"", ""supports"", ""mark()""); (""BufferedInputStream"", ""supports"", ""reset()""); (""InputStream"", ""has method"", ""markSupported()""); (""BufferedInputStream"", ""has method"", ""markSupported()"")"
"The newLine() method which can write a new-line character to the underlying Writer. In addition, you may need to call flush() if you need to be absolutely sure that the characters written until now is flushed out of the buffer and onto the network or disk.",
Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"(""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""poll()""); (""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""remove()""); (""Deque"", ""hasMethod"", ""remove()""); (""remove()"", ""throwsExceptionWhen"", ""Deque.isEmpty""); (""Queue"", ""isDifferentFrom"", ""remove()""); (""Queue.poll()"", ""isDifferentFrom"", ""Queue.remove()"")"
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,"(""set()"", ""contains"", ""synchronized blocks""); (""get()"", ""contains"", ""synchronized blocks""); (""set()"", ""has"", ""blocks""); (""get()"", ""has"", ""blocks""); (""blocks"", ""placed in"", ""set()""); (""blocks"", ""placed in"", ""get()"")"
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted. This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.",
The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle,"(""logrb()"", ""work like"", ""log()""); (""logrb()"", ""obtain from"", ""resource bundle""); (""log()"", ""work like"", ""logrb()"")"
The Handler in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord before writing it to an external system,"(""Handler"", ""use"", ""Formatter""); (""Formatter"", ""format"", ""LogRecord""); (""Handler"", ""write to"", ""external system""); (""LogRecord"", ""written by"", ""Handler""); (""Handler"", ""part of"", ""Java Logging API""); (""Formatter"", ""part of"", ""java.util.logging"")"
