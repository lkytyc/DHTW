"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the add() method will throw an exception.",
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the addLast() method will throw an exception.",

The remove() method removes the first element of a Java Deque.,"(""Deque"", ""hasMethod"", ""remove()"")"
"The pollFirst() method removes an element from the beginning of the Deque, just like poll().",

"Because the Iterator has its generic type set to String, the Java compiler already knows that next() will return a String.",
"As you can see, a proper implementation of .equals() is essential for your own classes to work well with the Java Collection classes.",
"So, as you can see, a combination of the hashCode() and equals() methods are used when storing and when looking up objects in a hashtable.",
"Then it uses a for-each loop to iterate the elements of the List, and print out the toString() value of each element.",
Here is an example of iterating the elements of an Iterable via its forEach() method:,"(""Iterable"", ""hasMethod"", ""forEach()"")"
"The reason the for-each loop is slower is, that each iteration will call the List iterator() method, which will create a new Iterator object.",
"In other words, if the Iterator has not yet iterated over all of the elements in the collection the Iterator was obtained from - the hasNext() method will return true.",
The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,"(""add()"", ""adds"", ""String"")"
"The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter, so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter.",
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.",
Since the Map does not contain any object stored by the key E the given default value will be returned - which is the String default value passed as the last parameter to the getOrDefault() method.,"(""Map"", ""does not contain"", ""object""); (""object"", ""stored by"", ""key E""); (""getOrDefault()"", ""returns"", ""default value""); (""default value"", ""is"", ""String default value""); (""getOrDefault()"", ""takes"", ""last parameter"")"

Here is an example of creating an instance of the Java TreeMap class which implements the NavigableMap interface:,"(""TreeMap"", ""implements"", ""NavigableMap"")"
"The tailMap variable will reference a SortedMap containing all key + value pairs from the NavigableMap for the keys ""c"", ""d"" and ""e"", as these keys are considered equal to or larger than the parameter value ""c"" passed to the tailMap() method.",
The lowerEntry() method in the NavigableMap interface returns the key + value pair for the highest key which is lower than the parameter value passed to the lowerEntry() method.,"(""NavigableMap"", ""hasMethod"", ""lowerEntry()"")"
"The pollFirstEntry() method returns and removes the ""first"" entry (key + value) in the NavigableMap or null if the map is empty.",
"The descendingIterator() method allows you to iterate the elements of the NavigableSet (which is also a SortedSet) in reverse order, without changing the order of the elements internally.",
"To get properties from a Java Properties object you use the getProperty() method, passing the key of the property to get as parameter.",
"Using the InputStream you can load the file into a Java Properties instance, using either the load() or loadFromXML() methods explained earlier in this Java Properties tutorial.",
Here are two examples of taking an element from a Java Queue using its poll() and remove() methods:,"(""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""poll()""); (""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""remove()"")"
You can check if a Java Queue contains a certain element via its contains() method.,"(""Queue"", ""hasMethod"", ""contains()"")"
The Java Set interface as a method called removeAll() which removes all elements in the Set which are also present in another Collection.,"(""Set"", ""hasMethod"", ""removeAll()""); (""removeAll()"", ""removesElements"", ""Collection"")"

The Java Collections API only has one implementation of the Java SortedSet interface - the java.util.TreeSet class.,"(""Java Collections API"", ""has implementation"", ""java.util.TreeSet""); (""java.util.TreeSet"", ""implements"", ""Java SortedSet interface"")"
"Additionally, the Vector class uses several older (no longer recommended) parts of Java, like the Enumeration which is superseded by the Iterator interface.",

Here is an example of obtaining the size of a Java Stack via its size() method:,"(""Stack"", ""hasMethod"", ""size()"")"
The lockWrite() method of a ReadWriteLock class shown below is an example of a test-and-set method.,"(""ReadWriteLock"", ""hasMethod"", ""lockWrite()"")"
The BoundedSemaphore class shown below has two test-and-set methods: take() and release().,"(""BoundedSemaphore"", ""hasMethod"", ""take()""); (""BoundedSemaphore"", ""hasMethod"", ""release()"")"

"Here are the two classes used in the example above, Counter and CounterThread.",
"The easiest way to create a subclass of ThreadLocal is to simply create an anonymous subclass, right where you create the ThreadLocal variable.",
"Here is an example of creating a ThreadLocal using its withInitial() static factory method, passing a simple Supplier implementation as parameter:",
Notice how the format() method calls the getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat() method to obtain a Java SimpleDatFormat instance.,"(""format()"", ""calls"", ""getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat()""); (""getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat()"", ""obtains"", ""SimpleDateFormat"")"
"The Counter class could have been written like this instead, using a Lock instead of a synchronized block:",

"When the thread is done with the code in the critical section (the code between lock() and unlock()), the thread calls unlock().",
"Otherwise, a single call to unlock() will unlock the lock, even if the lock has been locked multiple times.",
"That you would not call wait() and notify() on an internal monitor object, but rather on the This is probably true.",
This is how such exclusive access could look using a synchronized block in Java: public class SynchronizedCounter { long count = 0; public void inc() { synchronized(this) { count++; } } public long count() { synchronized(this) { return this.count; } } } Notice how the inc() and count() methods both contain a synchronized block.,"("" SynchronizedCounter"", ""contains"", ""inc() ""); ("" SynchronizedCounter"", ""contains"", ""count() ""); ("" inc()"", ""uses"", ""synchronized ""); ("" count()"", ""uses"", ""synchronized ""); ("" SynchronizedCounter"", ""hasField"", ""count "")"

"You can read more about it in the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore text, in my java.util.concurrent tutorial.",
The take() method sends a signal which is stored internally in the Semaphore.,"(""Semaphore"", ""hasMethod"", ""take()"")"
"That way the signal is not missed, even if doNotify() is called before doWait().",
"If you look at the Synchronizer class above and look into this Lock implementation you will notice that threads are now blocked trying to access the lock() method, if more than one thread calls lock() simultanously.",
"The thread calling unlock() will take the top QueueObject in the queue and call doNotify() on it, to awaken the thread waiting on that object.",
"The queueObject.doWait() call is placed outside the synchronized(this) block to avoid nested monitor lockout, so another thread can actually call unlock() when no thread is executing inside the synchronized(this) block in lock() method.",
"Below here is the PoolThreadRunnable class which implements the Runnable interface, so it can be executed by a Java thread:",
"Notice how the add() method returns a new ImmutableValue instance with the result of the add operation, rather than adding the value to itself.",
"The class java.lang.Object defines three methods, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), to facilitate this.",

To generate an asymmetric key pair you can use the KeyPairGenerator (java.security.KeyPairGenerator).,"(""KeyPairGenerator"", ""belongs to"", ""java.security""); (""KeyPairGenerator"", ""generates"", ""asymmetric key pair"")"
You create a KeyGenerator instance by calling the static method getInstance() passing as parameter the name of the encryption algorithm to create a key for.,"(""KeyGenerator"", ""method"", ""getInstance()""); (""KeyGenerator"", ""parameter"", ""encryption algorithm"")"
Initializing a KeyGenerator instance is done by calling its init() method.,"(""KeyGenerator"", ""hasMethod"", ""init()"")"

"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.",
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,"(""Java compiler"", ""requires"", ""class implementing the interface(s)""); (""class implementing the interface(s)"", ""implements"", ""method"")"
