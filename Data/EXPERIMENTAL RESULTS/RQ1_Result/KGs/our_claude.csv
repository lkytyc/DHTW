Remember that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (wait(), call, notify())""]"
The bigger the result String grows the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method,[]

Again here the first() and next() methods return the unicode index of the found word boundary,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (first(), return the unicode index, next())""]"
Obviously if the input parameter to contains() is null the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element but rather use the == operator,"[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (contains(), use the == operator to compare, equals())""]"
Both Java File and FileChannel works but in case you want a pure Java NIO solution use the Java NIO FileChannel class,[]

The poll() and remove() both removes the first element in the Queue. They differ in how they behave if the Queue is empty. The poll() method returns null if the Queue is empty. The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (poll(), behavior if the queue is empty, remove())""]"
"The add() and offer() methods differ in how the behave if the Queue is full, so no more elements can be added.

Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (queue.poll(), is different than, remove())""]"
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,"[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (set(), synchronized blocks placement, get())""]"
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted.
