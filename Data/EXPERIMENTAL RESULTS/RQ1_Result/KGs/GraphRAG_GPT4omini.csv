The remove() method throws an exception if the Queue is empty.,"(""poll"", ""The poll() method operates on the Queue class by removing the first element."", ""Queue""); (""remove"", ""The remove() method operates on the Queue class by removing the first element."", ""Queue"")"
"The add() and offer() methods differ in how the behave if the Queue is full, so no more elements can be added. The add() method throws an exception in that case, whereas the offer() method just returns false.","(""add"", ""The add() method interacts with the Queue class by attempting to add elements to it."", ""Queue""); (""offer"", ""The offer() method interacts with the Queue class by attempting to add elements to it."", ""Queue"")"
Each of the methods ceilingEntry() floorEntry() higherEntry() and lowerEntry() will be covered in the following sections,NULL
To do so set the upper bound to 1 and have the call to take() and release() guard the critical section,NULL
Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though you read and write data to and from it via Java IO InputStream and OutputStream classes,"(""Socket"", ""Socket is a network connection that can be read and written to using InputStream."", ""InputStream"")"
Many of the core components in the Java Collection API rely on the correct implementation of the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.,"(""Java Collection API"", ""The Java Collection API relies on the correct implementation of the hashCode() method."", ""hashCode()"")"
java.io.PrintWriter example first creates a PrintWriter instance which is connected to a FileWriter,"(""example"", ""The method 'example' creates an instance of the class 'PrintWriter'"", ""PrintWriter"")"
InputStream.read() example creates an AsynchronousFileChannel and then creates a ByteBuffer which is passed to the read() method as parameter along with a position of 0,"(""InputStream"", ""InputStream has a method called read() which is being invoked."", ""read()""); (""AsynchronousFileChannel"", ""AsynchronousFileChannel is created to work with ByteBuffer for reading data."", ""ByteBuffer"")"
java.lang.StringBuffer text explains how to use the SimpleDateFormat class to format dates,NULL
In general you can call the markSupported() method to find out if mark() and reset() are supported on a given InputStream or not but the BufferedInputStream supports them,"(""BufferedInputStream"", ""BufferedInputStream supports the markSupported() method to check for mark() and reset() support."", ""markSupported""); (""BufferedInputStream"", ""BufferedInputStream is a subclass of InputStream."", ""InputStream""); (""markSupported"", ""markSupported() is used to determine if mark() is supported."", ""mark"")"
"The newLine() method which can write a new-line character to the underlying Writer. In addition, you may need to call flush() if you need to be absolutely sure that the characters written until now is flushed out of the buffer and onto the network or disk.","(""newLine"", ""The newLine() method writes a new-line character to the underlying Writer."", ""Writer"")"
Queue.poll() is different than remove() which throws an exception if the Deque is empty,"(""Queue"", ""poll() is a method of the Queue class"", ""poll""); (""Deque"", ""remove() is a method of the Deque class"", ""remove"")"
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method. Notice how the blocks are placed last and first in the two methods.,NULL
"The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key. If no existing value is mapped to the given key, no value is inserted. This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.",NULL
The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle,NULL
The Handler in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord before writing it to an external system,"(""Handler"", ""The Handler uses a Formatter to format the LogRecord."", ""Formatter""); (""Handler"", ""The Handler formats the LogRecord before writing it to an external system."", ""LogRecord"")"
