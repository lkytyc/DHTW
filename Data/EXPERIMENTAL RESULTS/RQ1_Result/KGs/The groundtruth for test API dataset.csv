The Collections reverse() method can reverse the elements in a Java List.,
Here is an example of finding the minimum element in a Java List using Collections min() method:,
"Notice too, that the compareTo() method should throw a NullPointerException if the parameter object is null.","(compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)"
The LinkedList class is a pretty standard Deque and Queue implementation.,"(linkedlist, is a, deque), (linkedlist, is a, queue)"
You add elements to the beginning end of a Deque using the add() method.,"(deque, use, add())"
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the add() method will throw an exception.","(deque, use, add())"
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the addLast() method will throw an exception.","(deque, use, addlast())"
To peek at the last element of a Java Deque you can use the getLast() method.,"(deque, use, getlast())"
The remove() method removes the first element of a Java Deque.,"(remove(), removes, deque)"
"The pollFirst() method removes an element from the beginning of the Deque, just like poll().","(pollfirst(),like, poll),(pollfirst(), removes, deque)"
Here is an example of removing the last element from a Java Deque using the pollLast() method:,"(polllast(), use, deque)"
The Java Deque size() method returns the number of elements stored in the Java Deque at the time you invoke the method.,
"Because the Iterator has its generic type set to String, the Java compiler already knows that next() will return a String.",
"As you can see, a proper implementation of .equals() is essential for your own classes to work well with the Java Collection classes.","(.equals(), proper implementation, java collection)"
"So, as you can see, a combination of the hashCode() and equals() methods are used when storing and when looking up objects in a hashtable.","(hashcode(), used in, hashtable), (equals(), used in, hashtable)"
"Then it uses a for-each loop to iterate the elements of the List, and print out the toString() value of each element.","(for-each, iterate, list), (for-each, print out, tostring())"
Here is an example of iterating the elements of an Iterable via its forEach() method:,"(foreach(), iterating the elements, iterable)"
"The reason the for-each loop is slower is, that each iteration will call the List iterator() method, which will create a new Iterator object.","(iterator(), create, iterator)"
"In other words, if the Iterator has not yet iterated over all of the elements in the collection the Iterator was obtained from - the hasNext() method will return true.","(iterator, use, hasnext())"
The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,"(add(), adds, string)"
"The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter, so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter.","(addall(), takes as parameter, collection), (addall(), pass as parameter, list), (addall(), pass as parameter, set)"
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.",
Since the Map does not contain any object stored by the key E the given default value will be returned - which is the String default value passed as the last parameter to the getOrDefault() method.,"(string, default value, getordefault())"
"As you can see, the key Iterator returns every key stored in a Java Map, one by one (one for each call to next()).","(iterator, returns, map)"
The number of entries in a Java Map is also referred to as the Map size - hence the method name size() .,
The isEmpty() method will return false if the Map instance contains 1 or more entries.,
Here is an example of creating an instance of the Java TreeMap class which implements the NavigableMap interface:,"(treemap, implements, navigablemap)"
"The tailMap variable will reference a SortedMap containing all key + value pairs from the NavigableMap for the keys c, d and e, as these keys are considered equal to or larger than the parameter value c passed to the tailMap() method.","(tailMap, reference, SortedMap)"
The lowerEntry() method in the NavigableMap interface returns the key + value pair for the highest key which is lower than the parameter value passed to the lowerEntry() method.,"(navigablemap, includes, lowerentry())"
The pollFirstEntry() method returns and removes the first entry (key + value) in the NavigableMap or null if the map is empty.,"(navigablemap, includes, pollfirstentry())"
"The descendingIterator() method allows you to iterate the elements of the NavigableSet (which is also a SortedSet) in reverse order, without changing the order of the elements internally.","(descendingiterator(), iterate the elements of, navigableset), (descendingiterator(), iterate the elements of, sortedset)"
"To get properties from a Java Properties object you use the getProperty() method, passing the key of the property to get as parameter.","(properties, get by, getproperty())"

Here are two examples of taking an element from a Java Queue using its poll() and remove() methods:,"(poll(), work like, remove())"
You can check if a Java Queue contains a certain element via its contains() method.,"(queue, contains, contains()), (contains(), checks, Queue)"
The Java Set interface as a method called removeAll() which removes all elements in the Set which are also present in another Collection.,"(set, includes, removeall())"
You can check the size of a Java Set using the size() method.,"(set, includes, size()), (size(), checks, Set)"
"You iterate the keys of a SortedMap by calling its keySet() method, like this:","(sortedmap, includes, keyset())"
The SortedMap interface has a method named headMap() which returns a new Map which contains the first elements of the SortedMap according to the sort order used.,"(sortedmap, includes, headmap())"
Here is an example of obtaining a submap from a Java SortedMap via its subMap() method:,
The Java Collections API only has one implementation of the Java SortedSet interface - the java.util.TreeSet class.,"(java.util.treeset, implementation of, java.util.sortedset)"
"Additionally, the Vector class uses several older (no longer recommended) parts of Java, like the Enumeration which is superseded by the Iterator interface.","(enumeration, superseded by, iterator)"
You push elements onto a Java Stack using its push() method.,
Here is an example of obtaining the size of a Java Stack via its size() method:,
The lockWrite() method of a ReadWriteLock class shown below is an example of a test-and-set method.,"(readwritelock, includes, lockwrite())"
The BoundedSemaphore class shown below has two test-and-set methods: take() and release().,"(boundedsemaphore, has, take()), (boundedsemaphore, has, release())"
Here is an example showing how to implement the lock() method shown earlier using the AtomicBoolean class:,"(lock(), implement, atomicboolean)"

"The easiest way to create a subclass of ThreadLocal is to simply create an anonymous subclass, right where you create the ThreadLocal variable.",
"Here is an example of creating a ThreadLocal using its withInitial() static factory method, passing a simple Supplier implementation as parameter:","(threadlocal, created by, withinitial())"
Notice how the format() method calls the getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat() method to obtain a Java SimpleDatFormat instance.,"(format(), calls, getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat()), (getthreadlocalsimpledateformat(), obtain, simpledateformat)"
"The Counter class could have been written like this instead, using a Lock instead of a synchronized block:","(counter, using, lock)"

"When the thread is done with the code in the critical section (the code between lock() and unlock()), the thread calls unlock().",
"Otherwise, a single call to unlock() will unlock the lock, even if the lock has been locked multiple times.","(unlock(), unlocks, lock)"
"That you would not call wait() and notify() on an internal monitor object, but rather on the This is probably true.",
This is how such exclusive access could look using a synchronized block in Java: public class SynchronizedCounter { long count = 0; public void inc() { synchronized(this) { count++; } } public long count() { synchronized(this) { return this.count; } } } Notice how the inc() and count() methods both contain a synchronized block.,"(synchronizedcounter, contains, inc()), (synchronizedcounter, contains, count())"

"That way the signal is not missed, even if doNotify() is called before doWait().","(donotify(), called before, dowait())"
"If you look at the Synchronizer class above and look into this Lock implementation you will notice that threads are now blocked trying to access the lock() method, if more than one thread calls lock() simultanously.",

"Below here is the PoolThreadRunnable class which implements the Runnable interface, so it can be executed by a Java thread:","(poolthreadrunnable, implements, runnable)"
"Notice how the add() method returns a new ImmutableValue instance with the result of the add operation, rather than adding the value to itself.","(add(), returns, immutablevalue)"
"The class java.lang.Object defines three methods, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), to facilitate this.","(java.lang.object, defines, wait()), (java.lang.object, defines, notify()), (java.lang.object, defines, notifyall())"

The methods notify() and notifyAll() do not save the method calls to them in case no threads are waiting when they are called.,"(notify(), like, notifyall())"
"If the doNotify() method had called notifyAll() instead of notify(), all waiting threads had been awakened and checked for signals in turn.","(notifyall(), called, notify())"
"The other of C and D would go back to waiting, because the thread discovering the signal clears it on the way out of doWait().",
"The method compareAndSet() allows you to compare the current value of the AtomicBoolean to an expected value, and if current value is equal to the expected value, a new value can be set on the AtomicBoolean.","(compareandset(), compare the current value, atomicboolean)"

"AtomicReference even has an advanced compareAndSet() method which lets you compare the reference to an expected value (reference) and if they are equal, set a new reference inside the AtomicReference object.","(atomicreference, includes, compareandset())"
Notice how it is no longer necessary to cast the referenced returned by get() because the compiler knows it will return a String reference.,

"If the BlockingQueue does not contain any elements, the element() method will throw a NoSuchElementException.",
The result of that is that the call() method will return a String.,
