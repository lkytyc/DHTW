Here is an example of iterating the elements of an Iterable via its forEach() method:,"(""Iterable"", ""has method"", ""Iterable.forEach()"")"
"The reason the for-each loop is slower is, that each iteration will call the List iterator() method, which will create a new Iterator object.",

The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,"(""add()"", ""adds"", ""String"")"
"The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter, so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter.",
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.",

"The Counter class could have been written like this instead, using a Lock instead of a synchronized block:",

"When the thread is done with the code in the critical section (the code between lock() and unlock()), the thread calls unlock().",
"Otherwise, a single call to unlock() will unlock the lock, even if the lock has been locked multiple times.",
"That you would not call wait() and notify() on an internal monitor object, but rather on the This is probably true.",

Here is how the lockRead() and unlockRead() methods looks after that change:,
Here is how the lockWrite() and unlockWrite() methods look after that change:,
"You can read more about it in the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore text, in my java.util.concurrent tutorial.",
The take() method sends a signal which is stored internally in the Semaphore.,"(""Semaphore"", ""contains method"", ""take()"")"
"That way the signal is not missed, even if doNotify() is called before doWait().",
"If you look at the Synchronizer class above and look into this Lock implementation you will notice that threads are now blocked trying to access the lock() method, if more than one thread calls lock() simultanously.",
"The thread calling unlock() will take the top QueueObject in the queue and call doNotify() on it, to awaken the thread waiting on that object.",
"The queueObject.doWait() call is placed outside the synchronized(this) block to avoid nested monitor lockout, so another thread can actually call unlock() when no thread is executing inside the synchronized(this) block in lock() method.",
"Below here is the PoolThreadRunnable class which implements the Runnable interface, so it can be executed by a Java thread:",
"Notice how the add() method returns a new ImmutableValue instance with the result of the add operation, rather than adding the value to itself.",
"The class java.lang.Object defines three methods, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), to facilitate this.",
"In other words, the calling thread must call wait() or notify() from inside a synchronized block.",
The methods notify() and notifyAll() do not save the method calls to them in case no threads are waiting when they are called.,"(""notify()"", ""is a method of"", ""Object""); (""notifyAll()"", ""is a method of"", ""Object"")"
"If the doNotify() method had called notifyAll() instead of notify(), all waiting threads had been awakened and checked for signals in turn.",
"The other of C and D would go back to waiting, because the thread discovering the signal clears it on the way out of doWait().",

"The compareAndSet() method can compare the reference stored in the AtomicReference instance with an expected reference, and if they two references are the same (not equal as in equals() but same as in ==), then a new reference can be set on the AtomicReference instance.",

In many cases it would have made sense to place the getLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class where the licensePlate field is located.,"(""Vehicle"", ""contains method"", ""Vehicle.getLicensePlate()"")"
"Here is the same instanceof example, but using a Truck object instead of a Car object: Truck truck = new Truck(); Vehicle vehicle = truck; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; After executing this code the isCar will contain the value false.",
The updateLicensePlate() method sets the license plate value on the licensePlate field in the Car class.,"(""Car"", ""has method"", ""Car.updateLicensePlate()""); (""Car.updateLicensePlate()"", ""sets value on field"", ""Car.licensePlate"")"
"The getLicensePlate() method, however, returns the value of the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class.",
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.",
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.",
"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.",
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.",
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.",
"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.",
"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.",
Now the result variable would end up with the value 12.5.,
