The Java Collection interface (java.util.Collection) is one of the root interfaces of the Java Collection API.,"['containment: (java.util.collection, is one of the root interfaces of, java collection api)']",[]
Adding an element to a Collection is done via the add() method.,"['implementation: (add(), method used for adding, collection)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (add(), method used for adding, collection)""]"
"The add() method adds the given element to the collection, and returns true if the Collection changed as a result of calling the add() method.","['modification: (add(), adds element to, collection)']",[]
"On the other hand, if you called add() on a List and the List already contained that element, the element would then exist twice in the List.","['dependency: (add(), calling_sequences, list)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (add(), calling_sequences, list)""]"
"The remove() method removes the given element from the Collection and returns true if the removed element was present in the Collection, and was removed.","['modification: (remove(), remove element from, collection)']",[]
"If the element was not present, the remove() method returns false.",,[]
You can also add a collection of objects to a Java Collection using the addAll().,"['implementation: (addall(), adds a collection of objects, collection)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (addall(), adds a collection of objects, collection)""]"
The Java Collection addAll() adds all elements found in the Collection passed as parameter to the method.,,[]
"If you had called add() with the Collection as parameter instead, the Collection object itself would have been added, not its elements.",,[]
Exactly how the addAll() method behaves depends on the Collection subtype.,,[]
The Java Collection removeAll() removes all elements found the Collection passed as parameter to the method.,,[]
"contains() returns true if the collection contains the element, and false if not.",,[]
"containsAll() returns true if the collection contains all the elements in the parameter collection, and false if not.",,[]
You can check the size of a collection using the size() method.,,[]
The Java Stream API provides a more functional programming approach to iterating and processing elements of e.g.,,[]
You obtain a stream from a collection by calling the stream() method of the given collection.,,[]
Then a Stream of strings is obtained by calling the items.stream() method.,,[]
"This is similar to how you obtain an Iterator by calling the items.iterator() method, but a Stream is a different animal than an Iterator.","['similarity: (items.iterator(), similar to, stream)', 'difference: (stream, different animal than, iterator)']","[""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (stream, different animal than, iterator)""]"
The Predicate interface contains a function called test() which the lambda expression passed as parameter above is matched against.,"['containment: (predicate, contains, test())']",[]
"If you look at the lambda expression above, you can see that it takes a single parameter item and returns a boolean - the result of the item.startsWith(""o"") method call.",,[]
"When you call the filter() method on a Stream, the filter passed as parameter to the filter() method is stored internally.","['dependency: (filter(), calls, stream)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (filter(), calls, stream)""]"
"The parameter passed to the filter() function determines what items in the stream should be processed, and which that should be excluded from the processing.",,[]
"If the Predicate.test() method of the parameter passed to filter() returns true for an item, that means it should be processed.",,[]
The collect() method is one of the stream processing methods on the Stream interface.,"['containment: (collect(), processing method on, stream)']",[]
"The min() and max() methods return an Optional instance which has a get() method on, which you use to obtain the value.","['containment: (min(), return an optional instance, max())', 'implementation: (min(), obtain the value, get())', 'implementation: (max(), obtain the value, get())']","[""('method', 'containment', 'method'): (min(), return an optional instance, max())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (min(), obtain the value, get())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (max(), obtain the value, get())""]"
In case the stream has no elements the get() method will return null.,,[]
The Comparator.comparing() method creates a Comparator based on the lambda expression passed to it.,,[]
"In fact, the comparing() method takes a Function which is a functional interface suited for lambda expressions.","['dependency: (comparing(), takes, function)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (comparing(), takes, function)""]"
The count() method simply returns the number of elements in the stream after filtering has been applied.,,[]
The count() method returns a long which is the count of elements in the stream after filtering etc.,,[]
The reduce() method can reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.,,[]
"The reduce() method takes a BinaryOperator as parameter, which can easily be implemented using a lambda expression.","['implementation: (reduce(), takes as parameter, binaryoperator)']",[]
The BinaryOperator.apply() method is the method implemented by the lambda expression above.,,[]
"Thus, the value created by the reduce() function is the accumulated value after processing the last element in the stream.",,[]
The reduce() method taking a BinaryOperator as parameter returns an Optional .,"['dependency: (reduce(), taking, binaryoperator)', 'creation: (reduce(), returns, optional)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (reduce(), taking, binaryoperator)"", ""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (reduce(), returns, optional)""]"
"In case the stream contains no elements, the Optional.get() returns null.",,[]

The reduce() method can be combined with the filter() method too.,"['implementation: (reduce(), combined with, filter())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (reduce(), combined with, filter())""]"
"The Java Collections class, java.util.Collections, contains a long list of utility methods for working with collections in Java.","['containment: (java collections, contains utility methods, java.util.collections)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java collections, contains utility methods, java.util.collections)""]"
The Java Collections addAll() method can add a variable number of elements to a Collection (typically either a List or a Set .,"['containment: (addall, can add elements to, collection)', 'containment: (addall, can add elements to, list)', 'containment: (addall, can add elements to, set)']",[]
Here is a java code example of calling the Collections addAll() method:,,[]
The Collections binarySearch() method can search a Java List for an element using a binary search algorithm.,,[]
The List must be sorted in ascending order before you search it using binarySearch() .,,[]
Here is an example of searching a List using the Collections binarySearch() method:,,[]
The Collections copy() method can copy all elements of a List into another List.,"['containment: (collections, include elements of, list)', 'dependency: (copy(), method can copy into, list)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (copy(), method can copy into, list)""]"
Here is a Java example of calling the Collections copy() method:,,[]
The Collections reverse() method can reverse the elements in a Java List.,"['modification: (collections.reverse(), reverse the elements, list)']",[]
The Collections shuffle() method can shuffle the elements of a List.,"['modification: (collections, shuffle_elements, list)', 'containment: (collections, method, shuffle())']",[]
Here is an example of shuffling a list with the Collections shuffle() method:,,[]
Here is an example of sorting a Java List using Collections sort() method:,,[]
The Java Collections copy() method can copy one List into another.,,[]
You provide the source and destination List instances as parameters to the copy() method.,,[]
The Collections min() method can find the minimum element in a List according to the natural ordering of the elements (see my Java List sorting tutorial).,"['containment: (collections.min(), find the minimum element in, list)']",[]
Here is an example of finding the minimum element in a Java List using Collections min() method:,,[]
The Collections max() method can find the maximum element in a List according to the natural order of the elements (see my Java List sorting tutorial).,"['containment: (collections, max() method can find the maximum element in, list)']",[]
The Java Collections replaceAll() method can replace all occurrences of one element with another element.,,[]
You pass the element to replace and the element to replace it with as parameters to the replaceAll() method.,,[]
"The Collections replaceAll() method returns true if any elements were replaced, and false if not.",,[]
The Collections replaceAll() method uses the equals() method of each element to determine if the element is equal to the element to replace or not.,"['implementation: (collections.replaceall(), uses, equals())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (collections.replaceall(), uses, equals())""]"
I have a written a few more details about how the equals() method works in my section about the Java equals() method.,,[]
The unmodifiableSet() method in the Java Collections class can create an immutable (unmodifiable) Set from a normal Java Set .,"['creation: (unmodifiableset(), create an immutable set, collections)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (unmodifiableset(), create an immutable set, collections)""]"
"The Java Comparable interface,java.lang.Comparable, represents an object which can be compared to other objects.",,[]
Several of the built-in classes in Java implements the Java Comparable interface.,,[]
"You can also implement the Java Comparable interface yourself, to make your own classes comparable.",,[]
"When a class implements the Java Comparable interface, this means that instances (objects) of that class can be compared to each other, as mentioned above.",,[]
Please keep in mind that the Comparable interface is intended for comparison of objects of the same class.,,[]
In the following section I will explain how the compareTo() method works.,,[]
The Java Comparable compareTo() method takes a single object as parameter and returns an int value.,,[]
"The int returned signal whether the object the compareTo() method is called on is larger than, equal to or smaller than the parameter object.",,[]
"The Java Integer class implements the Comparable interface, so you can call compareTo() Here is an example:","['implementation: (integer, implements, comparable)', 'dependency: (integer, call, compareto())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (integer, implements, comparable)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (integer, call, compareto())""]"
Since the value 45 is smaller than 99 - the first comparison ( valA.compareTo(valB) = 45.compareTo(99) ) results in the value -1 being returned.,,[]
"In the second comparison, when 99 is compared to 45 ( valB.compareTo(valA) = 99.compareTo(45) ) the result is 1 - because 99 is larger than 45.",,[]
Here is an example of a Spaceship class which can compare itself to other Spaceship instances:,,[]
This way you can implement compareTo() to compare base on multiple factors.,,[]
"By specifying a type parameter when implementing the Comparable interface, the compareTo() method parameter changes from Object to whatever type you have specified.","['implementation: (comparable, specifying a type parameter changes the compareto() method parameter, compareto())']",[]
"Notice how there is no type parameter specified after the ""implements Comparable"" interface in the class declaration.",,[]
"Notice also, how the parameter type of the compareTo() object is no longer Spaceship, but Object.",,[]
"Finally, also notice how it is now necessary to cast the parameter of the compareTo() method to Spaceship explicitly.",,[]
"Notice too, that the compareTo() method should throw a NullPointerException if the parameter object is null.","['interruption: (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)""]"
"Similarly, the compareTo() method should throw a ClassCastException if the input parameter is not of the same class as the class of the object compareTo() is called on.","['interruption: (compareto(), throw, classcastexception)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (compareto(), throw, classcastexception)""]"
You can just cast to the desired class (as in the example above).,,[]
"If the classes do not match, the Java VM will throw a ClassCastException.",,[]
"The Java Comparator interface, java.util.Comparator, represents a component that can compare two objects so they can be sorted using sorting functionality in Java.",,[]
When sorting e.g a Java List you can pass a Java Comparator to the sorting method.,"['dependency: (list, requires, comparator)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (list, requires, comparator)""]"
"This method, the compare() method, takes two objects which the Comparator implementation is intended to compare.",,[]
The compare() method returns an int which signals which of the two objects was larger.,,[]
Imagine you have the following Spaceship class that you would like to be able to compare instances of:,,[]
"Notice that the Spaceship class already implements the Comparable interface which compares Spaceship objects on spaceshipClass first, and then registrationNo.","['implementation: (spaceship, implements, comparable)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (spaceship, implements, comparable)""]"
"First, notice how the SpaceshipComparator class implements the Comparator interface with the type Spaceship specified inside the < > characters ( implements Comparator<Spaceship> ).","['implementation: (spaceshipcomparator, implements, comparator)', 'implementation: (spaceshipcomparator, type specified as, spaceship)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (spaceshipcomparator, implements, comparator)""]"
"Setting the generic type of the Comparator implementation to Spaceship means that the parameter types of the compare() method can be set to Spaceship, and not Object as it would have been - if no generic type had been specified ( implements Comparator ).","['implementation: (comparator, set generic type as spaceship, compare())']",[]
"A Java Comparator implementation is pretty much always specialized to be able to compare objects of a specific type (class), so specifying a generic type in your Comparator implementation almost always makes sense.",,[]
"Second, notice how the compare() method returns the registrationNo of the first Spaceship parameter compared to the registrationNo of the second Spaceship parameter.",,[]
"Imagine if the registrationNo variable of the Spaceship class was an int instead, so getRegistrationNo() would return an int.","['conversion: (spaceship, variable type change from int, getregistrationno())']",[]
"The Java Deque interface, java.util.Deque, represents a double ended queue, meaning a queue where you can add and remove elements to and from both ends of the queue.","['similarity: (java deque, represents a double ended queue, java.util.deque)']",[]

The Java ArrayDeque class stores its elements internally in an array.,,[]
Before you can use a Java Deque you must create an instance of one of the classes that implements the Deque interface.,,[]
You add elements to the beginning end of a Deque using the add() method.,,[]
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the add() method will throw an exception.","['dependency: (add(), inserted into, deque)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (add(), inserted into, deque)""]"

The methods hashCode() and equals() play a distinct role in the objects you insert into Java collections.,,[]
equals() is used in most collections to determine if a collection contains a given element.,,[]
"The ArrayList iterates all its elements and execute ""123"".equals(element) to determine if the element is equal to the parameter object ""123"".",,[]
It is the String.equals() implementation that determines if two strings are equal.,,[]
"The ArrayList again iterates all its elements and execute ""123"".equals(element) to determine if the element is equal to the parameter object ""123"".",,[]
"As you can see, a proper implementation of .equals() is essential for your own classes to work well with the Java Collection classes.",,[]
"That depends on your application, the classes, and what you are trying to do.",,[]
"The hashCode() method of objects is used when you insert them into a HashTable, HashMap or HashSet.",,[]
"If you do not know the theory of how a hashtable works internally, you can read about hastables on Wikipedia.org.",,[]
The hashtable then iterates this area (all keys with the same hash code) and uses the key's equals() method to find the right key.,,[]
"So, as you can see, a combination of the hashCode() and equals() methods are used when storing and when looking up objects in a hashtable.",,[]
"Here are two rules that are good to know about implementing the hashCode() method in your own classes, if the hashtables in the Java Collections API are to work correctly:",,[]
Here are two example implementation of the hashCode() method matching the equals() methods shown earlier:,,[]
For a 100% precise description of how to implement equals() and hashCode() you should check out the official JavaDoc's.,,[]
The purpose of this text was mostly to explain how they are used by the Java Collection classes.,,[]

If the Iterator has iterated over all elements in the underlying collection - the hasNext() method returns false.,,[]
The second method to pay attention to is the next() method.,,[]
The next() method returns the next element of the collection the Iterator is iterating over.,"['implementation: (iterator, iterating over, next())']",[]
In that case you will get a ConcurrentModificationException the next time you call the Iterator next() method.,"['interruption: (iterator.next(), exception, concurrentmodificationexception)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (iterator.next(), exception, concurrentmodificationexception)""]"
The Java Iterator interface has a remove() method which lets you remove the element just returned by next() from the underlying collection.,"['dependency: (iterator, requires_remove_to, remove())', 'dependency: (iterator, requires_next_to, next())']","[""('interface', 'dependency', 'method'): (iterator, requires_remove_to, remove())"", ""('interface', 'dependency', 'method'): (iterator, requires_next_to, next())""]"
"The Java Iterator forEachRemaining() method can iterate over all of the elements remaining in the Iterator internally, and for each element call a Java Lambda Expression passed as parameter to forEachRemaining() .","['implementation: (iterator.foreachremaining(), iterate over, lambda expression)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (iterator.foreachremaining(), iterate over, lambda expression)""]"
Here is an example of using the Java Iterator forEachRemaining() method:,,[]
"The Java List interface, java.util.List, represents an ordered sequence of objects.",,[]
"If the List is not typed, using Java Generics, then you can even mix objects of different types (classes) in the same List.","['containment: (list, mix objects of different types, generics)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, mix objects of different types, generics)""]"
These List implementations are explained in more detail in my java.util.concurrent tutorial .,,[]
You create a List instance by creating an instance of one of the classes that implements the List interface.,,[]
"Remember, most often you will use the ArrayList class, but there can be cases where using one of the other implementations might make sense.",,[]
"Thus, you need to cast them to the concrete class (or interface) that you know the object to be of.","['conversion: (class, cast_to, interface)']",[]
You insert elements (objects) into a Java List using its add() method.,"['containment: (list, inclusion, add())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, inclusion, add())""]"
Here is an example of adding elements to a Java List using the add() method:,"['containment: (list, using the add() method, add())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, using the add() method, add())""]"
The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,"['containment: (add(), addition, string instance)']",[]
"The List interface has a version of the add() method that takes an index as first parameter, and the element to insert as the second parameter.","['containment: (list, has a version of, add())']",[]
"The addAll() method takes a Collection as parameter, so you can pass either a List or Java Set as parameter.",,[]
"In other words, you can add all elements from a List or Set into a List with addAll() .",,[]
The indexOf() method finds the index of the first occurrence in the List of the given element.,,[]
The lastIndexOf() method finds the index of the last occurrence in the List of a given element.,,[]
You can check if a Java List contains a given element using the List contains() method.,"['containment: (list, contains, contains())']",[]
Here is an example of checking if a Java List contains an element using the contains() method:,,[]
"Obviously, if the input parameter to contains() is null, the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element, but rather use the == operator.","['alternative: (contains(), use the == operator, equals())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (contains(), use the == operator, equals())""]"
The Java List interface contains a clear() method which removes all elements from the list when called.,"['containment: (list, contains, clear())']",[]
Here is simple example of removing all elements from a List (clearing) with the clear() method:,,[]
"After the clear() method has been called, the List will be completely empty.","['modification: (clear(), called, list)']",[]
The Java List interface has a method called retainAll() which is capable of retaining all elements from one List which are also present in another List.,"['containment: (list, includes, retainall())']",[]
"In other words, the retain() method removes all the elements from the target List which are not found in the other List.",,[]
Here is a Java example of calling the List retainAll() method:,,[]
"Third, the retainAll() method is called on list, passing otherList as parameter.",,[]
"After list.retainAll(otherList) has finished executing, the list will only contain those elements which were both present in list and otherList before retainAll() was called.",,[]
You can obtain the number of elements in the List by calling the size() method.,"['dependency: (list, obtain number of elements by calling, size())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (list, obtain number of elements by calling, size())""]"
The Java List interface has a method called subList() which can create a new List with a subset of the elements from the original List.,"['creation: (list, create, sublist())']","[""('interface', 'creation', 'method'): (list, create, sublist())""]"
The subList() method takes 2 parameters: A start index and and end index.,,[]
Here is a Java example of creating a sublist of elements from another List using the subList() method:,,[]
"After executing the list.subList(1,3) instruction the sublist will contain the elements at index 1 and 2.",,[]
"The list.subList(1,3) call will include index 1, but exclude index 3, thereby keeping the elements at index 1 and 2.",,[]
You can convert a Java List to a Java Array using the List toArray() method.,,[]
"Note that even if we pass a String array of size 0 to the toArray(), the array returned will have all the elements in the List in it.",,[]
It is the Arrays.asList() method that converts the array to a List.,,[]
You can sort a Java List using the Collections sort() method.,,[]
"If the List contains objects that implement the Comparable interface (java.lang.Comparable), then the objects can compare themselves to each other.",,[]
"The Java String class implements the Comparable interface, you can sort them in their natural order, using the Collections sort() method.","['implementation: (string, implements, comparable)', 'dependency: (string, sort them in their natural order using, sort())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (string, implements, comparable)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (string, sort them in their natural order using, sort())""]"
"If the objects in the Java List do not implement the Comparable interface, or if you want to sort the objects in another order than their compare() implementation, then you need to use a Comparator implementation (java.util.Comparator).","['dependency: (list, require, comparable)', 'alternative: (list, use, comparator)', 'alternative: (list, use, java.util.comparator)', 'alternative: (comparable, use, comparator)', 'alternative: (comparable, use, java.util.comparator)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (list, require, comparable)""]"
You obtain an Iterator by calling the iterator() method of the List interface.,"['creation: (iterator, obtain by calling, iterator())', 'dependency: (iterator(), method of, list)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (iterator, obtain by calling, iterator())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (iterator(), method of, list)""]"
Once you have obtained an Iterator you can keep calling its hasNext() method until it returns false.,"['dependency: (iterator, obtaining, hasnext())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (iterator, obtaining, hasnext())""]"
Calling hasNext() is done inside a while loop as you can see.,,[]
Inside the while loop you call the Iterator next() method of the Iterator interface to obtain the next element pointed to by the Iterator.,"['dependency: (iterator, requires calling, next())']","[""('interface', 'dependency', 'method'): (iterator, requires calling, next())""]"
"Inside the for loop the example accesses the elements in the List via its get() method, passing the incrementing variable i as parameter.",,[]
"Again, if the List is typed using Java Generics to e.g.",,[]
"Hence, the compiler knows that only a String can be returned from the get() method.",,[]
Therefore you do not need to cast the element returned by get() to String.,,[]
Obtaining a Stream from a List in Java is done by calling the List stream() method.,"['conversion: (list, obtaining a stream by calling the stream() method, stream())']",[]
It is the last line of this example that calls the List stream() method to obtain the Stream representing the elements in the List.,"['dependency: (list, calls, stream())', 'containment: (list, elements in, stream)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (list, calls, stream())"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (list, elements in, stream)""]"
Once you have obtained a Stream from a List you can iterate the Stream by calling its forEach() method.,"['dependency: (stream, obtained from, list)', 'dependency: (stream, iterate by calling, foreach())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stream, iterate by calling, foreach())""]"
Here is an example of iterating the elements of a List using the Stream forEach() method:,,[]
"Calling the forEach() method will make the Stream iterate all the element of the Stream internally, and call the Consumer passed as parameter to the forEach() method for each element in the Stream.","['dependency: (foreach(), iterate all elements, stream)', 'dependency: (foreach(), call consumer for each element, consumer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (foreach(), iterate all elements, stream)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (foreach(), call consumer for each element, consumer)""]"
"The Java Map interface, java.util.Map, represents a mapping between a key and a value.",,[]
To create a Java Map you must create an instance of one the classes that implement the Java Map interface.,,[]
To add elements to a Map you call its put() method.,"['dependency: (map, to add elements, put())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (map, to add elements, put())""]"
The three put() calls maps a string value to a string key.,,[]
Here is an example of auto-boxing primitive parameters passed to the put() method:,,[]
The value passed to the put() method in the above example is a primitive int.,,[]
"Java auto-boxes it inside an Integer instance though, because the put() method requires an Oject instance as both key and value.","['conversion: (integer, auto-boxed inside, put())']",[]
Auto-boxing would also happen if you passed a primitive as key to the put() method.,,[]
"If you call put() more than once with the same key, the latest value passed to put() for that key will overwrite what is already stored in the Map for that key.","['modification: (put(), overwrite, map)']",[]
To obtain the value stored by the null key you call the get() method with null as parameter value.,,[]
Just keep in mind that you will get a null out when you call get() later with that key - so this will return null:,,[]
The Java Map interface has a method called putAll() which can copy all key + value pairs (entries) from another Map instance into itself.,"['containment: (map, has_method, putall())']",[]
Here is an example of copying all entries from one Java Map into another via putAll():,"['implementation: (putall(), copying all entries from one java map into another, map)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (putall(), copying all entries from one java map into another, map)""]"
"Calling mapB.putAll(mapA) will only copy entries from mapA into mapB, not from mapB into mapA.",,[]
"To copy entries the other way, you would have to execute the code mapA.putAll(mapB).",,[]
"To get a specific element stored in a Java Map you call its get() method, passing along the key for that element as parameter.",,[]
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",,[]
"If we had specified a generic type for the key and value of the Map, then it would not have been necessary to cast the object returned by get() method.",,[]
The Java Map interface has a getOrDefault() method which can return a default value supplied by you - in case no value is stored in the Map by the given key.,"['containment: (map, has a method, getordefault())']",[]
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.","['dependency: (map, calls, getordefault())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (map, calls, getordefault())""]"
Since the Map does not contain any object stored by the key E the given default value will be returned - which is the String default value passed as the last parameter to the getOrDefault() method.,"['containment: (string, default value, map)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (string, default value, map)""]"
You can check if a Java Map contains a specific key using the containsKey() method.,,[]
You can iterate all the keys of a Java Map via its keySet() method.,,[]
"As you can see, the key Iterator returns every key stored in a Java Map, one by one (one for each call to next()).",[],[]
"Once you have the key, you can obtain the element stored for that key using the Map get() method.","['implementation: (map, obtain the element stored for that key using the, get())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (map, obtain the element stored for that key using the, get())""]"

Notice how a generic type is now also specified for the Iterator obtained from map.keySet().iterator().,,[]
You obtain a Collection of the values stored in a Map via the values() method.,"['containment: (collection, obtained from, map)', 'containment: (collection, obtained via, values())', 'dependency: (collection, requires, values())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (collection, obtained from, map)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (collection, obtained via, values())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (collection, requires, values())""]"
Notice how the key and value can be obtained from each Map.Entry instance.,,[]
You can remove all entries in a Java Map using the clear() method.,"['modification: (clear(), remove all entries, map)']",[]
It is possible to replace an element in a Java Map using the replace() method.,,[]
The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key.,,[]
"This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.",,[]
Here is an example of replacing one value with another using the Java Map replace() method:,,[]
You can read the number of entries in a Java Map using the size() method.,,[]
The number of entries in a Java Map is also referred to as the Map size - hence the method name size() .,,[]
Here is an example of reading the number of entries in a Map using the size() method:,,[]
This method is called isEmpty() and it returns either true or false.,,[]
The isEmpty() method will return false if the Map instance contains 1 or more entries.,,[]
The Map compute() method takes a key object and a lambda expression as parameters.,,[]
Here is an example of calling the Java Map compute() method:,,[]
"The compute() method will call the lambda expression internally, passing the key object and whatever value is stored in the Map for that key object, as parameters to the lambda expression.",,[]
"In the example above you can see that the lambda expression checks if the value mapped to the given key is null or not, before calling toString().toUpperCase() on it.","['dependency: (tostring(), calling sequence, touppercase())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (tostring(), calling sequence, touppercase())""]"
"The Map computeIfAbsent() method works similarly to the compute() method, but the lambda expression is only called if no entry exists already for the given key.","['similarity: (map, works similarly to, computeifabsent())', 'similarity: (map, works similarly to, compute())', 'difference: (map, but the lambda expression is only called if no entry exists already for the given key, computeifabsent())']",[]

"The Map merge() method takes a key, a value, and a lambda expression implementing the BiFunction interface as parameters.","['implementation: (map.merge(), takes, bifunction)']",[]
"If the Map does not have an entry for the key, or if the value for the key is null, the value passed as parameter to the merge() method is inserted for the given key.","['dependency: (map, has_entry_for, merge())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (map, has_entry_for, merge())""]"

"This class has a compareAndSet() function which will compare the value of the AtomicBoolean instance to an expected value, and if has the expected value, it swaps the value with a new value.","['containment: (compareandset(), function of, atomicboolean)']",[]
"The compareAndSet() method returns true if the value was swapped, and false if not.",,[]
Many of the concurrency utilities in the java.util.concurrent Java package are designed for use with this model.,,[]
Non-blocking IO means that when a worker starts an IO operation (e.g.,,[]
"When the IO operation finishes, the result of the IO operation ( e.g.",,[]
It just needs to know what channel to forward the job to (or send the message to etc.).,,[]
"The main disadvantage of the assembly line concurrency model is that the execution of a job is often spread out over multiple workers, and thus over multiple classes in your project.",,[]
"Of course parallel worker code may also be spread over many different classes, but the execution sequence is often easier to read from the code.",,[]
With Java 7 we got the java.util.concurrent package contains the ForkAndJoinPool which can help you implement something similar to functional parallelism.,"['containment: (java.util.concurrent, contains, java.util.concurrent.forkandjoinpool)']",[]
"However, if the system is concurrently executing multiple other tasks (like e.g.",,[]
when a Java application is started its main() method is executed by the main thread - a special thread that is created by the Java VM to run your application.,"['creation: (java vm, creates, main())']",[]
"Threads are instances of class java.lang.Thread, or instances of subclasses of this class.",,[]
"To start the Java thread you will call its start() method, like this:",,[]
The first is to create a subclass of Thread and override the run() method.,"['creation: (thread, create, run())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (thread, create, run())""]"
The second method is to pass an object that implements Runnable (java.lang.Runnable to the Thread constructor.,"['implementation: (runnable, implements, java.lang.runnable)', 'creation: (runnable, pass to, thread)']",[]
"The first way to specify what code a thread is to run, is to create a subclass of Thread and override the run() method.","['implementation: (thread, to run, run())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (thread, to run, run())""]"
The run() method is what is executed by the thread after you call start().,"['dependency: (run(), executed after calling, start())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), executed after calling, start())""]"
The start() call will return as soon as the thread is started.,,[]
The run() method will execute as if executed by a different CPU.,,[]
"When the run() method executes it will print out the text ""MyThread running"".",,[]
You can also create an anonymous subclass of Thread like this:,,[]
"This example will print out the text ""Thread running"" once the run() method is executed by the new thread.","['implementation: (thread, executes, run())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (thread, executes, run())""]"
The second way to specify what code a thread should run is by creating a class that implements the java.lang.Runnable interface.,,[]
Whatever the thread is supposed to do when it executes must be included in the implementation of the run() method.,,[]
The first way to implement the Java Runnable interface is by creating your own Java class that implements the Runnable interface.,,[]
Here is an example of a custom Java class that implements the Runnable interface:,,[]
"After printing that text, the run() method exits, and the thread running the run() method will stop.",,[]
Here is an example of an anonymous Java class that implements the Runnable interface:,,[]
"Apart from being an anononymous class, this example is quite similar to the example that used a custom class to implement the Runnable interface.",,[]
"To have the run() method executed by a thread, pass an instance of a class, anonymous class or lambda expression that implements the Runnable interface to a Thread in its constructor.","['creation: (thread, pass an instance to, runnable)']",[]
When the thread is started it will call the run() method of the MyRunnable instance instead of executing it's own run() method.,,[]
Sometimes you may have to implement Runnable as well as subclass Thread.,"['alternative: (runnable, implement as well as subclass, thread)']",[]
"For instance, if creating a subclass of Thread that can execute more than one Runnable.","['creation: (thread, can execute more than one, runnable)']",[]
"When creating and starting a thread a common mistake is to call the run() method of the Thread instead of start(), like this:","['dependency: (run(), calling sequence incorrect when used instead of, start())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), calling sequence incorrect when used instead of, start())""]"
At first you may not notice anything because the Runnable's run() method is executed like you expected.,,[]
Instead the run() method is executed by the thread that created the thread.,,[]
"To have the run() method of the MyRunnable instance called by the new created thread, newThread, you MUST call the newThread.start() method.","['dependency: (start(), must invoke before, run())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (start(), must invoke before, run())""]"
"For instance, if multiple threads write to System.out it can be handy to see which thread wrote the text.",,[]
"Notice however, that since the MyRunnable class is not a subclass of Thread, it does not have access to the getName() method of the thread executing it.","['difference: (myrunnable, does not have access to, getname())', 'dependency: (myrunnable, executing, thread)']",[]
The Thread.currentThread() method returns a reference to the Thread instance executing currentThread() .,,[]
First it prints out the name of the thread executing the main() method.,,[]
"Note that even if the threads are started in sequence (1, 2, 3 etc.)",,[]
"they may not execute sequentially, meaning thread 1 may not be the first thread to write its name to System.out.",,[]
A thread can pause itself by calling the static method Thread.sleep() .,,[]
The sleep() method will attempt to sleep that number of milliseconds before resuming execution.,,[]
"The Thread sleep() is not 100% precise, but it is pretty good still.",,[]
Here is an example of pausing a Java thread for 3 seconds (3.000 millliseconds) by calling the Thread sleep() method:,,[]
"The thread executing the Java code above, will sleep for approximately 10 seconds (10.000 milliseconds).",,[]
"The Java Thread class contains a stop() method, but it is deprecated.","['containment: (thread, contains, stop())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (thread, contains, stop())""]"
The original stop() method would not provide any guarantees about in what state the thread was stopped.,,[]
Instead of calling the stop() method you will have to implement your thread code so it can be stopped.,,[]
Here is an example of a class that implements Runnable which contains an extra method called doStop() which signals to the Runnable to stop.,"['interruption: (runnable, signals to stop, dostop())']",[]
The doStop() is intended to be called from another thread than the thread executing the MyRunnable's run() method.,"['dependency: (dostop(), called from another thread, run())', 'dependency: (dostop(), intended to be called by, myrunnable)', 'dependency: (run(), executing method of, myrunnable)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dostop(), called from another thread, run())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (dostop(), intended to be called by, myrunnable)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (run(), executing method of, myrunnable)""]"
The keepRunning() method is called internally by the thread executing the MyRunnable's run() method.,"['dependency: (keeprunning(), is called by, run())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (keeprunning(), is called by, run())""]"
As long as doStop() has not been called the keepRunning() method will return true - meaning the thread executing the run() method will keep running.,"['dependency: (dostop(), determines running state of, keeprunning())', 'dependency: (dostop(), influences execution of, run())', 'dependency: (keeprunning(), affects continuation of, run())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dostop(), determines running state of, keeprunning())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dostop(), influences execution of, run())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (keeprunning(), affects continuation of, run())""]"
"Here is an example of starting a Java thread that executes an instance of the above MyRunnable class, and stopping it again after a delay:",,[]
"Then the thread executing the main() method (the main thread) sleeps for 10 seconds, and then calls the doStop() method of the MyRunnable instance.","['dependency: (main(), calls, dostop())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (main(), calls, dostop())""]"
"This will cause the thread executing the MyRunnable method to stop, because the keepRunning() will return false after doStop() has been called.","['dependency: (myrunnable, depends on, keeprunning)', 'interruption: (dostop, causes, keeprunning)']",[]
Please keep in mind that if your Runnable implementation needs more than just the run() method (e.g.,,[]
"a stop() or pause() method too), then you can no longer create your Runnable implementation with a Java lambda expression.","['alternative: (stop(), create or instantiate, pause())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (stop(), create or instantiate, pause())""]"
"Instead you must use a custom class, or a custom interface that extends Runnable which has the extra methods, and which is implemented by an anonymous class.",,[]
You will have to create a custom lock class or use one of the Java 5 concurrency constructs in the java.util.concurrency package.,,[]
"Every time a thread takes a lock it is noted in a data structure (map, graph etc.)",,[]
Here is an example of a TreeNode class that call synchronized methods in different instances:,"['dependency: (treenode, calls, synchronized)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (treenode, calls, synchronized)""]"
"If a thread (1) calls the parent.addChild(child) method at the same time as another thread (2) calls the child.setParent(parent) method, on the same parent and child instances, a deadlock can occur.","['dependency: (addchild, occurs concurrent with, setparent)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (addchild, occurs concurrent with, setparent)""]"
Here is some pseudo code that illustrates this: Thread 1: parent.addChild(child); //locks parent --> child.setParentOnly(parent); Thread 2: child.setParent(parent); //locks child --> parent.addChildOnly() First thread 1 calls parent.addChild(child).,"['dependency: (addchild, calls, addchildonly)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (addchild, calls, addchildonly)""]"
Since addChild() is synchronized thread 1 effectively locks the parent object for access from other treads.,,[]
Since setParent() is synchronized thread 2 effectively locks the child object for acces from other threads.,,[]
"Next thread 1 tries to call child.setParentOnly() method, but the child object is locked by thread 2, so the method call just blocks.",,[]
"Thread 2 also tries to call parent.addChildOnly() but the parent object is locked by thread 1, causing thread 2 to block on that method call.",,[]
"Note: The two threads must call parent.addChild(child) and child.setParent(parent) at the same time as described above, and on the same two parent and child instances for a deadlock to occur.","['dependency: (parent.addchild(), calling sequence, child.setparent())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (parent.addchild(), calling sequence, child.setparent())""]"

"https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/ The LMAX Disrupter concurrent data structure (a single reader, single writer queue-like structure with high concurrency).",,[]
In the following code example I have created an example of such a communication mechanism - a Java class called FrameExchanger.,,[]
It is not important how this class looks in order to understand how the FrameExchanger works.,,[]
"The producing thread will call storeFrame() continuously, and the drawing thread will call takeFrame() continuously.","['dependency: (storeframe(), calls, takeframe())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (storeframe(), calls, takeframe())""]"
Notice how the three instructions inside the storeFrame() method seem like they do not depend on each other.,,[]
"That means, that if the drawing thread is waiting in the while-loop in the takeFrame() method, the drawing thread could exit that while-loop, and take the old Frame object.",,[]
Notice that the first instruction is a read of a volatile variable (other.volatileVarC).,,[]
"When other.volatileVarC is read in from main memory, the other.nonVolatileB and other.nonVolatileA are also read in from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why this guarantee is necessary, let us modify the FrameExchanger class from earlier in this tutorial to have the hasNewFrame variable be declared volatile:",,[]
"Additionally, every time the drawing thread reads the hasNewFrame variable in the while-loop inside the takeFrame() method, the frame and framesStoredCount will also be refreshed from main memory.",,[]
"Imagine if the Java VM reordered the instructions inside the storeFrame() method, like this:",,[]
"This means, that the drawing thread executing the takeFrame() method may exit the while-loop before the new value is assigned to the frame variable.",,[]
"As you can see, the reordering of the instructions inside storeFrame() method may make the application malfunction.",,[]
"In the case of the storeFrame() method that means that the two first write instructions cannot be reordered to happen after the last write to hasNewFrame, since hasNewFrame is a volatile variable.",,[]
"This reordering does not break the code in the takeFrame() method, as the frame variable is still written to before the hasNewFrame variable is written to.",,[]
"Because of the volatile read visibility guarantee, when this.volatileVarA is read from main memory, so are all other variables visible to the thread at that time.",,[]
"Thus, this.nonVolatileVarB and this.nonVolatileVarC are also read in from main memory at the same time.",,[]
"With regards to the takeFrame() method, the first read of a volatile variable is the read of the hasNewFrame field inside the while-loop.",,[]
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method.,"['dependency: (set(), synchronized blocks, get())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (set(), synchronized blocks, get())""]"
In the set() method the synchronized block at the end of the method will force all the variables to be synchronized to main memory after being updated.,,[]
In the get() method the synchronized block is placed at the beginning of the method.,"['containment: (get(), placed at the beginning of, synchronized)', 'containment: (get(), method of, block)', 'containment: (get(), method of, method)']",[]
"When the thread calling get() enters the synchronized block, all variables are re-read in from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why, I will use the get() method of the ValueExchanger shown earlier:",,[]
"As you can see, the synchronized block at the beginning of the method will guarantee that all of the variables this.valC, this.valB and this.valA are refreshed (read in) from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why, I will use the set() method of the ValueExchanger shown earlier:",,[]
"As you can see, the synchronized block at the end of the method will guarantee that all of the changed variables this.valA, this.valB and this.valC will be written back to (flushed) to main memory when the thread calling set() exits the synchronized blocks.",,[]
"The original Java memory model was insufficient, so the Java memory model was revised in Java 1.5.","['modification: (java, was revised, java)']",[]
Static class variables are also stored on the heap along with the class definition.,,[]
If two threads were executing the run() method then the diagram shown earlier would be the outcome.,,[]
methodOne() declares a primitive local variable (localVariable1 of type int) and an local variable which is an object reference (localVariable2).,,[]
Each thread executing methodOne() will create its own copy of localVariable1 and localVariable2 on their respective thread stacks.,,[]
Each thread executing methodOne() will also create their own copy of localVariable2.,,[]
The localVariable1 reference will be stored in one copy per thread executing methodTwo().,,[]
The Integer objects created inside methodTwo() correspond to Object 1 and Object 5 in the diagram above.,,[]
Notice also the two member variables in the class MySharedObject of type long which is a primitive type.,,[]
That is why Java 5 got a whole set of concurrency utility classes to help developers implement more fine grained concurrency control than what you get with synchronized.,,[]
Notice the use of the synchronized keyword in the add() method declaration.,,[]
Also here the synchronized keyword tells Java that the add() method is synchronized.,,[]
Synchronized static methods are synchronized on the class object of the class the synchronized static method belongs to.,,[]
"Since only one class object exists in the Java VM per class, only one thread can execute inside a static synchronized method in the same class.","['containment: (class, contains, method)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contains, method)""]"
"In case a class contains more than one static synchronized method, only one thread can execute inside any of these methods at the same time.","['containment: (class, contains, method)']",[]
Only one thread can execute inside any of the two add() and subtract() methods at any given time.,"['dependency: (add(), execute inside, subtract())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (add(), execute inside, subtract())""]"
If Thread A is executing add() then Thread B cannot execute neither add() nor subtract() until Thread A has exited add().,"['dependency: (add(), execution restriction, subtract())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (add(), execution restriction, subtract())""]"
"If the static synchronized methods are located in different classes, then one thread can execute inside the static synchronized methods of each class.","['containment: (synchronized methods, are located in, classes)']",[]
One thread per class regardless of which static synchronized method it calls.,"['dependency: (thread, synchronization, class)', 'dependency: (thread, calls, method)', 'containment: (class, contains, method)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contains, method)""]"
These methods are synchronized on the class object of the class the methods belong to:,"['containment: (class object, are synchronized on, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class object, are synchronized on, methods)""]"
"Had the second synchronized block been synchronized on a different object than MyClass.class, then one thread could execute inside each method at the same time.",,[]
It is even possible to use synchronized blocks inside a Java Lambda Expression as well as inside anonymous classes.,"['containment: (synchronized, use inside, anonymous classes)']",[]
Notice that the synchronized block is synchronized on the class object of the class containing the lambda expression.,"['containment: (synchronized block, contains, class object)']",[]
"It could have been synchronized on another object too, if that would have made more sense (given a specific use case), but using the class object is fine for this example.",,[]
"Here are the two classes used in the example above, Counter and CounterThread.","['containment: (counterthread, contains, counter)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (counterthread, contains, counter)""]"
"The Counter.add() method is synchronized on the instance, because the add method is an instance method, and marked as synchronized.",,[]
Therefore only one of the threads can call the add() method at a time.,,[]
"The other thread will wait until the first thread leaves the add() method, before it can execute the method itself.",,[]
"If the two threads had referenced two separate Counter instances, there would have been no problems calling the add() methods simultaneously.",,[]
Calling add() on counterA will thus not block a call to add() on counterB.,,[]
Without the use of the synchronized keyword (or the Java volatile keyword) there is no guarantee that when one thread changes the value of a variable shared with other threads (e.g.,,[]
"If you call Integer.valueOf(1) multiple times, it might actually return the same wrapper object instance for the same input parameter values.",,[]
"That means, that if you are synchronizing multiple blocks on the same primitive wrapper object (e.g.",,[]
"use Integer.valueOf(1) multiple times as monitor object), then you risk that those synchronized blocks all get synchronized on the same object.","['dependency: (integer, risk of synchronized blocks on the same object, integer.valueof())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (integer, risk of synchronized blocks on the same object, integer.valueof())""]"
"To be on the safe side, synchronize on this - or on a new Object() .",,[]
Java actually comes with a built in ReadWriteLock class you can use.,,[]
Java actually comes with a built-in Java Semaphore class you can use.,,[]
Just focus on how inside the synchronized block inside the count() method calls the count() method recursively.,,[]
"Thus, the thread calling count() may eventually enter the same synchronized block multiple times.",,[]
The Java ThreadLocal class enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread.,,[]
"Thus, the Java ThreadLocal class provides a simple way to make code thread safe that would not otherwise be so.",,[]
Once a ThreadLocal has been created you can set the value to be stored in it using its set() method.,"['modification: (threadlocal, set value, set())']",[]
You read the value stored in a ThreadLocal using its get() method.,"['dependency: (threadlocal, get_method_usage, get())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (threadlocal, get_method_usage, get())""]"
"Additionally, you do not have to typecast the value returned by get().",,[]
It is possible to set an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal which will get used the first time get() is called - before set() has been called with a new value.,"['dependency: (threadlocal, initial value used before set, get())', 'dependency: (get(), called before, set())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (threadlocal, initial value used before set, get())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (get(), called before, set())""]"
The first way to specify an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal variable is to create a subclass of ThreadLocal which overrides its initialValue() method.,"['creation: (threadlocal, create a subclass which overrides, initialvalue())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (threadlocal, create a subclass which overrides, initialvalue())""]"
"The easiest way to create a subclass of ThreadLocal is to simply create an anonymous subclass, right where you create the ThreadLocal variable.","['creation: (threadlocal, create an anonymous subclass, threadlocal)']",[]
Here is an example of creating an anonymous subclass of ThreadLocal which overrides the initialValue() method:,"['creation: (threadlocal, creating an anonymous subclass with the initialvalue() method, initialvalue())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (threadlocal, creating an anonymous subclass with the initialvalue() method, initialvalue())""]"
"Only if you return the exact same object from the initialValue() method, will all threads see the same object.",,[]

Here is how providing a Supplier implementation as a lambda expression to withInitial() looks:,,[]
Notice how the format() method calls the getThreadLocalSimpleDateFormat() method to obtain a Java SimpleDatFormat instance.,"['dependency: (format(), calls, getthreadlocalsimpledateformat())', 'creation: (getthreadlocalsimpledateformat(), obtain, simpledateformat)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (format(), calls, getthreadlocalsimpledateformat())""]"
"The SimpleDateFormat class is not thread safe, so multiple threads cannot use it at the same time.",,[]
"To solve this problem, the MyDateFormatter class above creates a SimpleDateFormat per thread, so each thread calling the format() method will use its own SimpleDateFormat instance.","['creation: (mydateformatter, creates, simpledateformat)', 'dependency: (simpledateformat, used by, format())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (simpledateformat, used by, format())""]"
"Both threads execute the run() method, and thus sets different values on the ThreadLocal instance.","['implementation: (run(), sets different values, threadlocal)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (run(), sets different values, threadlocal)""]"
"If the access to the set() call had been synchronized, and it had not been a ThreadLocal object, the second thread would have overridden the value set by the first thread.",,[]
"The udpate() method writes three variables, of which only days is volatile.",,[]
Notice the totalDays() method starts by reading the value of days into the total variable.,,[]
Let us look at the MyClass class from the example earlier in this Java volatile tutorial:,,[]
"Once the update() method writes a value to days, the newly written values to years and months are also written to main memory.",,[]
As an alternative to a synchronized block you could also use one of the many atomic data types found in the java.util.concurrent package.,,[]

It is the condition inside the while loop (spin lock) that determines if a thread is allowed to exit the lock() method or not.,,[]

Thread synchronization can also be achieved using other synchronization constructs like locks or atomic variables like java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.,,[]

Java 5 comes with read / write lock implementations in the java.util.concurrent package.,,[]
The rules for read access are implemented in the lockRead() method.,,[]
The rules for write access are implemented in the lockWrite() method.,,[]
It is worth noting that both unlockRead() and unlockWrite() calls notifyAll() rather than notify().,"['dependency: (unlockread(), calls, notifyall())', 'dependency: (unlockwrite(), calls, notifyall())', 'difference: (notifyall(), rather than, notify())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (unlockread(), calls, notifyall())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (unlockwrite(), calls, notifyall())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (notifyall(), rather than, notify())""]"
"If a thread awakened by notify() was a read access thread, it would be put back to waiting because there are threads waiting for write access.",,[]
By calling noftifyAll() all waiting threads are awakened and check if they can get the desired access.,,[]
"If multiple threads are waiting for read access and none for write access, and unlockWrite() is called, all threads waiting for read access are granted read access at once - not one by one.",,[]

To achieve this the writeLock() method should be changed a bit.,,[]
Here is how the canGrantReadAccess() method will look with that change:,,[]
"When guarding a critical section with a ReadWriteLock, and the critical section may throw exceptions, it is important to call the readUnlock() and writeUnlock() methods from inside a finally-clause.","['dependency: (readwritelock, requires calling sequence with, readunlock())', 'dependency: (readwritelock, requires calling sequence with, writeunlock())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (readwritelock, requires calling sequence with, readunlock())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (readwritelock, requires calling sequence with, writeunlock())""]"

Java 5 comes with semaphore implementations in the java.util.concurrent package so you don't have to implement your own semaphores.,,[]
"You can read more about it in the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore text, in my java.util.concurrent tutorial.","['containment: (java.util.concurrent.semaphore, included in, java.util.concurrent)']",[]

The Semaphore implementation in the previous section does not count the number of signals sent to it by take() method calls.,,[]
Notice how the take() method now blocks if the number of signals is equal to the upper bound.,,[]

In contrast to the signaling use case the methods take() and release() are now called by the same thread.,"['dependency: (take(), called by the same thread, release())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (take(), called by the same thread, release())""]"

The relase() method is called from inside a finally-block to make sure it is called even if an exception is thrown from the critical section.,,[]
In a classic multi-threaded architecture you will typically assign each task to a separate thread for execution.,,[]
A classic multi-threaded architecture can also sometimes lead to congestion when multiple threads try to access the same data structure at the same time.,,[]
The alternative to a classic multithreaded architecture is a single-threaded or same-threaded.,,[]

"Thus, at most N threads can pass the acquire() method without any release() calls, where N is the number of permits the semaphore was initialized with.","['dependency: (acquire(), requirement on n release() calls, release())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (acquire(), requirement on n release() calls, release())""]"

"If no permits are available, the acquire() call will block until a permit is released by another thread.",,[]
"Similarly, a release() calls is blocked if no more permits can be released into this semaphore.",,[]
"For instance, if acquire was called after Thread 1 had inserted an object in a shared list, and Thread 2 had called release() just before taking an object from that list, you had essentially created a blocking queue.",,[]
"That is, there is no guarantee that the first thread to call acquire() is also the first thread to obtain a permit.",,[]
"If you want to enforce fairness, the Semaphore class has a constructor that takes a boolean telling if the semaphore should enforce fairness.",,[]
Calling this class a queue is a bit of an overstatement.,,[]
"However, unless you need to specify all these parameters explicitly for your ThreadPoolExecutor, it is often easier to use one of the factory methods in the java.util.concurrent.Executors class, as shown in the ExecutorService text.","['alternative: (threadpoolexecutor, use of the factory methods in, java.util.concurrent.executors)', 'alternative: (threadpoolexecutor, as shown in, executorservice)']",[]
"A Java Certificate class instance contains name plus other details of the entity it identifies, plus possibly a digital signature from a Certificate Authority (CA).",,[]
"The Java Certificate class is an abstract class, so while you may use Certificate as variable type, your variable will always point to a subclass of Certificate.",,[]
The Java Certificate class has one subclass - the X509Certificate class.,"['containment: (certificate, has subclass, x509certificate)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (certificate, has subclass, x509certificate)""]"
This class represents an X.509 certificate which is used as identity certificate in HTTPS and TLS.,,[]
The Java Certificate getEncoded() method returns an encoded version of the Certificate as a byte array.,"['conversion: (certificate, returns an encoded version, getencoded())']",[]
"For instance, if the Certificate is an X509Certificate the returned byte array will contain an X.590 (ASN.1 DER) encoded version of the Certificate instance.","['containment: (x509certificate, contain, certificate)', 'conversion: (certificate, encoded version, der)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (x509certificate, contain, certificate)"", ""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (certificate, encoded version, der)""]"
The Java Certificate getPublicKey() method returns the PublicKey of this Certificate instance.,"['containment: (getpublickey(), returns, publickey)', 'containment: (getpublickey(), of, certificate)']",[]
The Java Certificate getType() method returns the type of the Certificate instance.,,[]
The Java CertificateFactory class (java.security.cert.CertificateFactory) is capable of creating Java Certificate instances from binary certificate encodings like X.509 (ASN.1 DER).,"['creation: (certificatefactory, capable of creating, java.security.cert.certificatefactory)']",[]
"To read more about the Java Certificate class, see the Java Certificate tutorial.",,[]
See the Java CertPath tutorial for more information about the CertPath class.,,[]
This example creates a CertificateFactory instance capable of creating X.509 certificate instances (X509Certificate - a subclass of Certificate).,"['creation: (certificatefactory, creates, x509certificate)', 'creation: (certificatefactory, creates, certificate)', 'containment: (x509certificate, subclass of, certificate)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (x509certificate, subclass of, certificate)""]"
You create a CertPath instance by calling the CertificateFactory generateCertPath() method.,"['creation: (certificatefactory, generatecertpath, certpath)']",[]
"The Java CertPath class (java.security.cert.CertPath represents a chain of cryptographic identity certificates (Java Certificate objects), where each certificate is the digital signer of the next certificate in the chain.",,[]
The Java CertPath class is typically used to verify an identity certificate along with the certificates of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that signed the certificate.,,[]
Once you have a Java CertPath instance you can obtain the Certificate instances the CertPath consists of by calling the CertPath getCertificates() method.,"['containment: (certpath, consists of, certificate)', 'dependency: (certpath, obtain by calling, getcertificates())', 'containment: (certpath, consists of, getcertificates())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (certpath, consists of, certificate)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (certpath, obtain by calling, getcertificates())"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (certpath, consists of, getcertificates())""]"
The CertPath getType() method returns a string telling what type of certificates (e.g.,"['containment: (certpath, returns, gettype())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (certpath, returns, gettype())""]"
Here is an example of obtaining the CertPath type via getType():,"['implementation: (certpath, obtaining, gettype())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (certpath, obtaining, gettype())""]"
That is why the Java class is called Cipher and not e.g.,,[]
This Java Cipher tutorial will explain how the Cipher class of the Java Cryptography API works.,"['implementation: (cipher, class of, java cryptography api)']",[]
Before you can use a Java Cipher you just create an instance of the Cipher class.,,[]
You create a Cipher instance by calling its getInstance() method with a parameter telling what type of encryption algorithm you want to use.,"['creation: (cipher, create, getinstance())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (cipher, create, getinstance())""]"
There are several overridden versions of both update() and doFinal() which takes different parameters.,"['alternative: (update(), overridden versions, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), overridden versions, dofinal())""]"
"If you have to encrypt or decrypt a single block of data, just call the doFinal() with the data to encrypt or decrypt.",,[]
"If you have to encrypt or decrypt multiple blocks of data, e.g.",,[]
"multiple blocks from a large file, you call the update() once for each block of data, and finish with a call to doFinal() with the last data block.","['dependency: (update(), calling_sequence, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling_sequence, dofinal())""]"
"The reason a call to doFinal() is needed for the last block of data is, that some encryption algorithms need to pad the the data to fit a certain cipher block size (e.g.",,[]
"Hence the calls to update() for intermediate blocks of data, and the call to doFinal() for the last block of data.","['dependency: (update(), calls to, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calls to, dofinal())""]"
"When decrypting multiple blocks of data you also call the Cipher update() method for intermediate data blocks, and the doFinal() method for the last block.","['dependency: (cipher.update(), calling sequence, cipher.dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (cipher.update(), calling sequence, cipher.dofinal())""]"
The Java Cipher class encryption and decryption methods can encrypt or decrypt part of the data stored in a byte array.,"['implementation: (cipher, can encrypt, encrypt)', 'implementation: (cipher, can decrypt, decrypt)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (cipher, can encrypt, encrypt)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (cipher, can decrypt, decrypt)""]"
You simply pass an offset and length to the update() and / or doFinal() method.,"['dependency: (update(), pass an offset and length, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), pass an offset and length, dofinal())""]"
You can encrypt or decrypt data into an existing byte array by passing the destination byte array as parameter to the update() and / or doFinal() method.,"['dependency: (update(), passing the destination byte array as a parameter to, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), passing the destination byte array as a parameter to, dofinal())""]"
If you want to set a different offset for the dest byte array there is a version of update() and doFinal() which takes an offset parameter extra.,"['alternative: (update(), offset parameter alternative, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), offset parameter alternative, dofinal())""]"
Here is an example of calling the doFinal() method with an offset into the dest array:,,[]
"When you call the doFinal() method on a Cipher instance, the Cipher instance is returned to the state it had just after initialization.","['dependency: (dofinal(), call sequence, cipher)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (dofinal(), call sequence, cipher)""]"
Notice the call to update() and then doFinal() for these two blocks of data.,"['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())""]"
This is done with the doFinal() call with the third data block.,,[]
After this doFinal() call you can encrypt yet another block of data with the same Java Cipher instance.,"['dependency: (dofinal(), call, cipher)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (dofinal(), call, cipher)""]"
JCA is structured around some central general purpose classes and interfaces.,"['containment: (jca, is structured around, classes)', 'containment: (jca, is structured around, interfaces)']",[]
"Thus, you may use a Cipher class to encrypt and decrypt some data, but the concrete cipher implementation (encryption algorithm) depends on the concrete provider used.",,[]
The most commonly used of these classes are covered throughout the rest of this Java Cryptography tutorial.,,[]
The Provider (java.security.Provider) class is a central class in the Java cryptography API.,"['containment: (provider, is a central class in, java.security.provider)']",[]
"The Cipher class is explained in more detail in the text on the Java Cipher class, but I will give a brief introduction to the Cipher class in the following sections.","['containment: (cipher, explained in more detail in, java cipher)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cipher, explained in more detail in, java cipher)""]"
"The Cipher.getInstance(...) method take a String identifying which encryption algorithm to use, as well as a few other configurations of the algorithm.",,[]
"To initialize a Cipher instance to decrypt data you have to use the Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, like this:","['implementation: (cipher, use, decrypt_mode)']",[]
You do so by calling the Cipher update() or doFinal() methods.,"['dependency: (cipher.update(), invocation, cipher.dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (cipher.update(), invocation, cipher.dofinal())""]"
The update() method is used if you are encrypting or decrypting part of a bigger chunk of data.,,[]
"The doFinal() method is called when you are encrypting the last part of the big chunk of data, or if the block you pass to doFinal() represents the complete data block to encrypt.",,[]
Here is an example of encrypting some data with the doFinal() method,,[]
To decrypt data you would have passed cipher text (encrypted data) into the doFinal() or doUpdate() method instead.,"['dependency: (dofinal(), requirement to decrypt data, doupdate())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dofinal(), requirement to decrypt data, doupdate())""]"
"The example in the previous section about the Cipher class used a very simple, hardcoded key.",,[]
You can use the Java KeyGenerator class to generate more random encryption keys.,,[]
"The resulting SecretKey instance can be passed to the Cipher.init() method, like this:",,[]
To generate an asymmetric key pair you can use the KeyPairGenerator (java.security.KeyPairGenerator).,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, use, java.security.keypairgenerator)']",[]
The KeyStore class is quite advanced so it is described in more detail in its own Java KeyStore Tutorial.,,[]
You can use the Java MessageDigest (java.security.MessageDigest) to calculate message digests.,,[]
In order to calculate a message digest of some data you call the update() or digest() method.,"['dependency: (update(), calling_sequence, digest())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling_sequence, digest())""]"
"The update() method can be called multiple times, and the message digest is updated internally.",,[]
"When you have passed all the data you want to include in the message digest, you call digest() and get the resulting message digest data out.",,[]
Here is an example of calling update() several times followed by a digest() call:,"['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, digest())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, digest())""]"
You can also call digest() a single time passing all the data to calculate the message digest from.,,[]
The Java Mac class is used to create a MAC from a message.,,[]
"The Mac class is described in more detail in the Java Mac tutorial, but below is a short introduction.",,[]
"You create a Java Mac instance by calling the Mac.getInstance() method, passing as parameter the name of the algorithm to use.","['creation: (mac, create by calling, mac.getinstance)']",[]
Once the Mac instance is initialized you can calculate a MAC from data by calling the update() and doFinal() method.,"['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())""]"
"If you have all the data to calculate the MAC for, you can call the doFinal() method immediately.",,[]
"If you only have the access to the data in separate blocks, call update() multiple times with the data, and finish off with a call to doFinal().","['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, dofinal())""]"
You do so by calling the initSign(...) method passing the private key to use to sign the data.,,[]
You do so by calling update() passing the data to sign as parameter.,,[]
You can call the update() method several times with more data to include when creating the signature.,,[]
When all the data has been passed to the update() method you call the sign() method to obtain the digital signature.,"['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, sign())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, sign())""]"
This is done by calling the initVerify(...) method passing as parameter the public key to use to verify the signature.,,[]
"Once initialized into verification mode, you call the update() method with the data the signature is signing, and finish with a call to verify() which returns true or false depending on whether the signature could be verified or not.","['dependency: (update(), calling sequence, verify())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), calling sequence, verify())""]"
Here is a full example of both creating and verifying a digital signature with the Signature class:,,[]
The Java KeyGenerator class (javax.crypto.KeyGenerator) is used to generate symmetric encryption keys.,"['creation: (javax.crypto.keygenerator, used to generate, keygenerator)']",[]
Before you can use the Java KeyGenerator class you must create a KeyGenerator instance.,,[]
You create a KeyGenerator instance by calling the static method getInstance() passing as parameter the name of the encryption algorithm to create a key for.,"['creation: (keygenerator, create, getinstance)']",[]
Initializing a KeyGenerator instance is done by calling its init() method.,"['creation: (keygenerator, initialization, init())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (keygenerator, initialization, init())""]"

Generating a key is done by calling the KeyGenerator generateKey() method.,,[]

You can access the PrivateKey of a KeyPair by calling the getPrivate() method.,,[]
The Java KeyPairGenerator class (java.security.KeyPairGenerator) is used to generate asymmetric encryption / decryption key pairs.,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, used to generate, java.security.keypairgenerator)']",[]
Creating a KeyPairGenerator instance is done by calling the method getInstance() method.,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, is created by calling, getinstance())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (keypairgenerator, is created by calling, getinstance())""]"
The getInstance() method takes the name of the encryption algorithm to generate the key pair for.,,[]
To generate a KeyPair with a KeyPairGenerator you call the generateKeyPair() method.,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, generate, generatekeypair())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (keypairgenerator, generate, generatekeypair())""]"
This makes the KeyStore class a useful mechanism to handle encryption keys securely.,,[]
You can create a Java KeyStore instance by calling its getInstance() method.,"['creation: (keystore, can be created by calling, getinstance)']",[]
It is also possible to create other types of KeyStore instance by passing a different parameter to the getInstance() method.,"['creation: (keystore, create instance using, getinstance())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (keystore, create instance using, getinstance())""]"
That is why the KeyStore class assumes that you must read its data in before you can use it.,,[]
Loading the KeyStore data from a file or other storage is done by calling the KeyStore load() method.,"['dependency: (keystore, calling the load() method, load())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (keystore, calling the load() method, load())""]"
This example loads the KeyStore file located in the keystore.ks file.,,[]
You can get the keys of a Java KeyStore instance via its getEntry() method.,"['containment: (keystore, has method, getentry())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (keystore, has method, getentry())""]"
"Thus, to access a key you must pass the key alias and password to the getEntry() method.",,[]
"If you know that the key entry you want to access is a private key, you can cast the KeyStore.Entry instance to a KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry.","['conversion: (keystore.entry, cast to, keystore.privatekeyentry)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (keystore.entry, cast to, keystore.privatekeyentry)""]"

The Java Mac (javax.crypto.Mac class can create a Message Authentication Code (MAC) from binary data.,,[]
Before you can use the Java Mac class you must create a Mac instance.,,[]
The String parameter passed to the Mac getInstance() method contains the name of the MAC algorithm to use.,"['containment: (getinstance(), contains the name of, mac)']",[]
You initialize the Mac instance by calling its init() method passing as parameter the secret key to be used by the Mac instance.,"['creation: (mac, initialize by calling its init() method, init())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (mac, initialize by calling its init() method, init())""]"

This tutorial only explains how to use the Java Cryptography API representation of a message digest in the MessageDigest class.,"['containment: (java cryptography api, representation of, messagedigest)']",[]
To create a Java MessageDigest instance you call the static getInstance() method of the MessageDigest class.,"['creation: (messagedigest, create instance, messagedigest)', 'dependency: (messagedigest, call method, getinstance)']",[]
The text parameter passed to the getInstance() method is the name of the concrete message digest algorithm to use.,,[]

Therefore I have put together this little trail on Java's date and time classes.,,[]
Hopefully that will help you get an overview of Java's date and time classes.,[],[]
I also hope it may clear up some of the confusion Sun has created with Java's many date and time classes.,"['containment: (java, contains many, date)', 'containment: (java, contains many, time)']",[]
"Actually, the Java date time API has been changed (cleaned up) in Java 8 with the introduction of a whole new set of classes.","['modification: (java date time api, changed in, classes)']",[]
The new Java date time API is located in the Java package java.time which is part of the standard Java 8 class library.,,[]
You will see this new date and time representation in many of the classes in the new Java date time API.,,[]
The java.time package also contains a set of subpackages which contain more utilities etc.,,[]
"For instance the java.time.chrono contains classes to work with Japanese, Thai, Taiwanese and Islamic calendars.",,[]
The java.time.format package contains classes used to parse and format dates from and to strings.,,[]
The core of the Java 8 date time API consists of the following classes:,,[]
Java 7 has the following date and time classes and methods.,,[]
"Each of these classes are also explained in their own pages, later.",,[]
If you need to do simple timing the System.currentTimeMillis() method will do just fine.,,[]
"If you just need an object to hold a date, for instance as a property in a simple domain model object, you can use the java.util.Date class.",,[]
"If you need to read and write the date and time to a database, use the java.sql.Date and java.sql.Timestamp classes.","['alternative: (java.sql.date, read and write the date and time, java.sql.timestamp)']",[]
"If you need to do date calculations like adding days or months to another date, or check what weekday (monday, tuesday etc.)",,[]
"a given date is, or convert dates and times between time zones, use the java.util.Calendar and java.util.GregorianCalendar classes.","['dependency: (java.util.calendar, use, java.util.gregoriancalendar)']",[]
The Java DateTimeFormatter class is used to parse and format dates represented with the classes in the Java 8 date time API.,,[]
The DateTimeFormatter is located in the java.time.format package so the fully qualified class name is java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.,"['containment: (java.time.format.datetimeformatter, located in, java.time.format)']",[]
The DateTimeFormatter class contains a set of predefined (constant) instances which can parse and format dates from standard date formats.,,[]
You can read about them in the JavaDoc for the DateTimeFormatter class.,,[]
Once you have an instance of a DateTimeFormatter you can format a date using its format() method.,"['implementation: (datetimeformatter, format a date using, format())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (datetimeformatter, format a date using, format())""]"
A Duration object (java.time.Duration) represents a period of time between two Instant objects.,"['containment: (duration, period of time between, instant)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (duration, period of time between, instant)""]"
The Duration class was added to the Java date time API from Java 8.,"['creation: (duration, was added to, java date time api)']",[]
Creating a Duration object is done using one of the Duration class factory methods.,"['creation: (duration, is done using one of, factory methods)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (duration, is done using one of, factory methods)""]"
Here is an example of how to create a Duration object using the between() method:,"['creation: (duration, create using, between())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (duration, create using, between())""]"
This is somewhat different from what we are used to with System.getCurrentTimeMillis() where a moment in time (or a period between two moments) is represented as a number of milliseconds.,,[]
The toNanos() is different from the getNano() in that the getNano() only returns the part of the Duration which is less than one second.,"['difference: (tonanos(), different from, getnano())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (tonanos(), different from, getnano())""]"
The toNanos() method returns the full time interval converted to nanoseconds.,,[]
You might be asking yourself if there is not a toSeconds() method.,,[]
You can obtain the seconds part of the Duration using the getSeconds() method as explained earlier.,"['implementation: (getseconds(), obtain seconds part, duration)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (getseconds(), obtain seconds part, duration)""]"
The Duration class contains a set of methods you can use to perform calculations based on a Duration object.,,[]
The Instant class in the Java date time API (java.time.Instant) represents a specific moment on the time line.,"['containment: (instant, class in the java date time api, java.time)']",[]
"Time is measured using 86.400 seconds per day, moving forward from the origin.",,[]
You create an Instant instance using one of the Instant class factory methods.,"['creation: (instant, creation through, instant class factory methods)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (instant, creation through, instant class factory methods)""]"
"For instance, to create an Instant which represents this exact moment of now, call Instant.now(), like this:",,[]
The Instant class also has several methods which can be used to make calculations relative to an Instant.,"['containment: (instant, has several, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (instant, has several, methods)""]"
The LocalDate class in the Java 8 date time API represents a local date which is a date without time zone information.,,[]
"The LocalDate Java class is located in the java.time package, so its fully qualified class name is java.time.LocalDate.","['containment: (java.time.localdate, is located in, java.time)']",[]
Here is an example of creating a LocalDate using the now() method:,,[]
"The LocalDate's of() method creates a LocalDate instance representing a specific day of a specific month of a specific year, but without time zone information.","['creation: (localdate, creates a localdate instance, of())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (localdate, creates a localdate instance, of())""]"
Notice how the getMonth() and getDayOfWeek() methods return an enum instead of an int.,"['similarity: (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())""]"
From these enums you can obtain their information as int values by calling their getValue() methods.,,[]
You can perform a set of simple date calculations with the LocalDate class using one or more of the following methods:,,[]
The LocalDateTime class in the Java 8 date time API (java.time.LocalDateTime) represents a local date and time without any time zone information.,,[]
You could view the LocalDateTime as a combination of the LocalDate and LocalTime classes of the Java 8 date time API.,"['containment: (localdatetime, combination of, localtime)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (localdatetime, combination of, localtime)""]"
Here is an example that shows how to create a LocalDateTime object via the now() method:,"['creation: (localdatetime, create, now())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (localdatetime, create, now())""]"
"The parameters to the of() method are year, month, day (of month), hours, minutes, seconds and nanoseconds.",,[]
Via the methods that return an enum you can get an int representation of the enum by calling the getValue() of the enum .,,[]
The LocalTime class in the Java 8 date time API represents a specific time of day without any time zone information.,,[]
"The LocalTime class is immutable, so all calculations on LocalTime objects return a new LocalTime instance.",,[]
"There are also other versions of the of() method that only takes hours and minutes, or hours, minutes and seconds as parameters.",,[]
The LocalTime class contains a set of methods that enable you to perform local time calculations.,,[]
The static method System.currentTimeMillis() returns the time since January 1st 1970 in milliseconds.,,[]
"The returned long value can be used to initialize java.util.Date, java.sql.Date, java.sql.Timestamp and java.util.GregorianCalendar objects.","['creation: (java.util.date, can be initialized with, returned long value)', 'creation: (java.sql.date, can be initialized with, returned long value)', 'creation: (java.sql.timestamp, can be initialized with, returned long value)', 'creation: (java.util.gregoriancalendar, can be initialized with, returned long value)']",[]
The granularity of the System.currentTimeMillis() method is larger than 1 millisecond.,,[]
Measuring time in Java is easiest to do with the System.currentTimeMillis() method.,,[]

"The calculations listed earlier in this text are rather trivial yet tedious to do, and could be encapsulated in a Timer class.",,[]
The ZonedDateTime class in the Java 8 date time API represents a date and time with time zone information.,,[]
The first way is to call the now() method of the ZonedDateTime class.,"['dependency: (zoneddatetime, call now method, now())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (zoneddatetime, call now method, now())""]"
Here is an example of creating a ZonedDateTime object using the now() method:,"['creation: (zoneddatetime, creating, now())']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (zoneddatetime, creating, now())""]"

The ZonedDateTime class contains a set of methods used for date time calculations.,"['containment: (zoneddatetime, contains, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (zoneddatetime, contains, methods)""]"
The time zones are represented by the ZoneId class as shown in the earlier example.,,[]

Java's java.util.Calendar class is used to do date and time arithmetic.,,[]
"Whenever you have something slightly more advanced than just representing a date and time, this is the class to use.",,[]
"Java only comes with a Gregorian calendar implementation, the java.util.GregorianCalendar class.",,[]
"The Calendar class has a couple of methods you can use to access the year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, milliseconds and time zone of a given date.",,[]
The Calendar class has a corresponding set() method so you can set these fields too.,"['containment: (calendar, has a corresponding method, set())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (calendar, has a corresponding method, set())""]"
"The add() method is really handy when doing date arithmetics like adding or subtracting years, months, days, hours etc.",,[]
"To subtract from the fields call the add() method with negative values, like this:",,[]
There are a few minor traps in the Calendar class that you should be aware of to avoid unnecessary headaches.,,[]

"That means that 1 = sunday, 2 = monday, ..., 7 = saturday.",,[]
If you need to do heavy or complex date and time calculations it is a good idea to read the class documentation for java.util.Calendar in the official JavaDoc's.,,[]
The class documentation contains more detail about the specific behaviour of the class.,,[]
Today most of the methods in the class are deprecated in favor of the java.util.Calendar class.,,[]
You can still use the java.util.Date class to represent a date though.,,[]
"You can access the date and time contained in a java.util.Date instance using the getTime() method, like this:","['containment: (java.util.date, contain, gettime())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (java.util.date, contain, gettime())""]"

"The Java TimeZone class is a class that represents time zones, and is helpful when doing calendar arithmetics across time zones.",,[]
The java.util.TimeZone class is used in conjunction with the java.util.Calendar class.,"['dependency: (java.util.timezone, conjunction with, java.util.calendar)']",[]
Note: In the Java 8 date time API the time zones are represented by the java.time.ZoneId class.,,[]
But you only need to use the ZoneId class if you are using the Java 8 date time classes (like the ZonedDateTime class).,"['dependency: (zoneid, use, zoneddatetime)']",[]
If you use a Calendar (from the Java 7 and earlier date time API) you can still use the java.util.TimeZone class.,"['dependency: (calendar, use, java.util.timezone)']",[]
The first method (TimeZone.getDefault()) returns the default time zone for the system (computer) this program is running on.,,[]
"The second method (TimeZone.getTimeZone(""Europe/Copenhagen"")) returns the TimeZone corresponding to the given time zone ID (in this example ""Europe/Copenhagen"").",,[]
"The getOffset() method returns the offset in milliseconds for the given time zone to UTC, at the given time.",,[]
The Calendar class is capable of converting the date and time between time zones.,,[]
"Here is a list of the available time zone ids in the TimeZone class, printed as returned by TimeZone.getAvailableIDs().","['containment: (timezone, include, timezone.getavailableids)']",[]
"It is possible to both parse dates from strings, and format dates to strings, using Java's java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.",,[]
It is also possible to parse and format dates using the newer Java DateTimeFormatter which is able to parse and format dates from and to the newer date time classes added in Java 8.,,[]
"Even though both classes for parsing and formatting dates are covered in more detail in their own texts, I will show you a few examples of how to use them below.",,[]
Here is an example of how to format and parse a date using the SimpleDateFormat class.,,[]
The string passed as parameter to the SimpleDateFormat class is a pattern that tells how the instance is to parse and format dates.,,[]

Another way to format dates is to use the DateTimeFormatter which works with the newer date time classes added in Java 8.,,[]
In the example above we use the DateTimeFormatter.BASIC_ISO_DATE instance which is configured to parse and format dates using the ISO date time format.,,[]
"Exceptions are regular Java classes that extends java.lang.Exception, or any of the other built-in exception classes.",,[]

"In the example above the ""System.out.println(""Division attempt done"");"" statement will always get executed.",,[]
Here is how the callDivide() method would look in that case.,,[]
"Thus the ""System.out.println(result);"" method will not get executed if an exception is thrown from the divide method.",,[]

"If the calling method also just throws the method on, the calling method is also interrupted at the openFile() method call, and the exception passed on up the call stack.",,[]
That is why the previous example had the reader.close() method call in the finally block wrapped in a try-catch block:,,[]
"That way the System.out.println(""--- File End ---""); method call will always be executed.",,[]
Notice how the two exception class names in the first catch block are separated by the pipe character |.,,[]
The pipe character between exception class names is how you declare multiple exceptions to be caught by the same catch clause.,"['containment: (exception, declare, catch)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (exception, declare, catch)""]"

"The storeDataFromUrl() method can still choose to catch the exception but it no longer has to, and it no longer has to declare that it propagates the exception.",,[]

Notice how the readNumberFromUrl() method does not declare throwing the ApplicationException even if it throws it.,"['dependency: (readnumberfromurl(), throws, applicationexception)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (readnumberfromurl(), throws, applicationexception)""]"
All exceptions thrown in the application must be a subclass of the base exception.,,[]

"A user's locale is represented by the Java Locale class, by the way.",,[]
This text takes a closer look at the ResourceBundle class and its subclasses.,,[]
The PropertyResourceBundle class stores localized texts in standard Java property files.,,[]
Then you pass that Locale instance to the ResourceBundle.getBundle() method along with the name of the resource bundle to load.,,[]
Finally you can access the localized values in the ResourceBundle via its different getString() and getObject() etc.,"['containment: (getstring(), contains_values, getobject())']","[""('method', 'containment', 'method'): (getstring(), contains_values, getobject())""]"

The java.text.SimpleDateFormat class is used to both parse and format dates according to a formatting pattern you specify yourself.,,[]

Once you have created a SimpleDateFormat instance you can format dates using its format() method.,"['implementation: (simpledateformat, format dates using its format() method, format())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (simpledateformat, format dates using its format() method, format())""]"
The Date instance passed to the format() method is a java.util.Date instance.,"['containment: (format(), is passed a, java.util.date instance)']",[]

It seems the format() method appends the formatted String to the end of the StringBuffer no matter what the int value passed to the FieldPosition constructor is.,"['containment: (format(), appends to, stringbuffer)']",[]
You can parse a String into a java.util.Date instance using the parse() method of the SimpleDateFormat instance.,"['dependency: (simpledateformat, parse(), java.util.date)', 'implementation: (simpledateformat, parse(), java.util.date)']",[]

"If an InputStream subclass supports the mark() and reset() methods, then that subclass should override the markSupported() to return true.","['dependency: (mark(), supports, reset())', 'dependency: (mark(), override to return true, marksupported())', 'containment: (mark(), subclass of, inputstream)', 'dependency: (reset(), supports, mark())', 'containment: (reset(), subclass of, inputstream)', 'dependency: (marksupported(), should override to true, inputstream)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (mark(), supports, reset())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (mark(), override to return true, marksupported())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (reset(), supports, mark())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (marksupported(), should override to true, inputstream)""]"
If the markSupported() method returns false then mark() and reset() are not supported.,"['dependency: (marksupported(), requirement, mark())', 'dependency: (marksupported(), requirement, reset())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (marksupported(), requirement, mark())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (marksupported(), requirement, reset())""]"
The mark() sets a mark internally in the InputStream which marks the point in the stream to which data has been read so far.,,[]
"If the code using the InputStream wants to go back to the point in the stream where the mark was set, the code calls reset() on the InputStream.","['dependency: (inputstream, calls_reset_on, reset())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (inputstream, calls_reset_on, reset())""]"
The methods mark() and reset() methods are typically used when implementing parsers.,"['implementation: (mark(), used for implementing parsers, reset())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (mark(), used for implementing parsers, reset())""]"
Notice how the while loop continues until a -1 value is read from the InputStream read() method.,,[]
"After that, the while loop exits, and the InputStream close() method is called.",,[]
"If an exception is thrown while reading data from the InputStream, the close() method is never called.","['interruption: (inputstream, exception is thrown while reading data, close())']",[]
"The Java InputStreamReader class, java.io.InputStreamReader, wraps a Java InputStream, thereby turning the byte based InputStream into a character based Reader.","['conversion: (inputstreamreader, wraps and turns into, inputstream)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (inputstreamreader, wraps and turns into, inputstream)""]"
The Java InputStreamReader class is thus a subclass of the Java Reader class.,"['containment: (inputstreamreader, subclass of, reader)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (inputstreamreader, subclass of, reader)""]"
You can get the character encoding used by a Java InputStreamReader instance via its getEncoding() method.,"['implementation: (getencoding(), used by, inputstreamreader)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (getencoding(), used by, inputstreamreader)""]"
The read() method of an InputStreamReader returns an int which contains the char value of the char read.,"['implementation: (inputstreamreader, method, read())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (inputstreamreader, method, read())""]"
"If the read() method returns -1, the end of stream has been reached, meaning there is no more data to read in the InputStreamReader.","['dependency: (read(), returns data from, inputstreamreader)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (read(), returns data from, inputstreamreader)""]"
"As you can see, the while loop keeps running until a -1 is read from the InputStreamReader read() method.","['dependency: (while, keeps running until read(), read())']",[]
"Once all the data is written to it, simply call the method toByteArray() or toCharArray, and all the data written is returned in array form.","['alternative: (tobytearray(), offers another option compared to, tochararray)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (tobytearray(), offers another option compared to, tochararray)""]"
The Java CharArrayReader class (java.io.CharArrayReader) enables you to read the contents of a char array as a character stream.,"['containment: (chararrayreader, contents of a char array, java.io)']",[]
"The Java CharArrayReader is handy when you have data in a char array, but need to pass that data to some component which can only read from a Reader (or a Reader subclass).","['containment: (chararrayreader, has data in, reader)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (chararrayreader, has data in, reader)""]"
Closing a CharArrayReader can be done using the close() method like this:,"['implementation: (chararrayreader, can be closed using, close())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (chararrayreader, can be closed using, close())""]"
Notice that there is no explicit close() call on the CharArrayReader.,"['interruption: (chararrayreader, no explicit close() call on, close())']",[]
The Java CharArrayWriter class (java.io.CharArrayWriter) makes it possible to write characters via the Writer methods (CharArrayWriter is a subclass of Writer) and convert the written characters into a char array.,"['containment: (chararraywriter, is a subclass of, writer)', 'conversion: (chararraywriter, makes it possible to write characters via, java.io.chararraywriter)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (chararraywriter, is a subclass of, writer)""]"
"The Java CharArrayWriter class is handy when you have a component that can only write characters to a Writer, but you need the characters as a char array.","['conversion: (chararraywriter, provides characters as, char array)', 'containment: (chararraywriter, writes characters to, writer)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (chararraywriter, provides characters as, char array)""]"

"Third, the written characters are obtained as a char array by calling the toCharArray() method on the CharArrayWriter.","['conversion: (tochararray(), obtained as a char array by calling, chararraywriter)']",[]
Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the CharArrayWriter instance.,"['interruption: (close(), explicit method call omission, chararraywriter)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (close(), explicit method call omission, chararraywriter)""]"
The Java DataOutputStream class enables you to write Java primitives to OutputStream's instead of only bytes.,"['containment: (dataoutputstream, writes to, outputstream)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (dataoutputstream, writes to, outputstream)""]"
"As mentioned earlier, the DataOutputStream class is often used together with a DataInputStream.","['dependency: (dataoutputstream, used together with, datainputstream)']",[]
But what happens if an exception is thrown from inside the doSomethingWithData() method?,,[]
"Well, to catch that situation you will have to wrap the call to close() in a try-catch block too, like this:",,[]
"But, what happens if an exception is also thrown from the input.close() method?",,[]
"Separate pages will describe each of these methods or classes in more detail, including examples of their usage etc.",,[]
The Java IO API contains the following classes which are relevant to working with files in Java:,,[]
"These classes are explained in more detail in their own texts, but the sections below will give a brief introduction to these classes.",,[]
"These two classes lets you read a file one byte or character at a time from the start to the end of the file, or read the bytes into an array of byte or char, again from start towards the end of the file.",,[]
"As I have already mentioned, you can get random access to files with Java IO via the RandomAccessFile class.",,[]
Both file and directory information is available via the File class.,,[]
The FilterInputStream is a base class for implementing your own filtering input streams.,,[]
"It is intended to be a base class for your own subclasses, but in my opinion you might as well just subclass InputStream directly.",,[]
I cannot see that this class actually adds or changes any behaviour in InputStream except that it takes an InputStream in its constructor.,,[]
The FilterOutputStream is a base class for implementing your own filtering output streams.,,[]
I cannot see that this class actually adds or changes any behaviour in OutputStream except that it takes an OutputStream in its constructor.,,[]
"If you choose to extend this class you might as well extend the OutputStream class directly, and avoid the extra class in the hierarchy.",,[]
The FilterReader is a base class for implementing your own filtering readers.,,[]
"Like with FilterInputStream, I see no sensible purpose for this class.",,[]
I cannot see that this class actually adds or changes any behaviour in Reader except that it takes a Reader in its constructor.,,[]
"If you choose to extend this class you might as well extend the Reader class directly, and avoid the extra class in the hierarchy.",,[]
The FilterWriter is a base class for implementing your own filtering Writer's.,,[]
"Like with FilterOutputStream, I see no sensible purpose for this class.",,[]
I cannot see that this class actually adds or changes any behaviour in Writer except that it takes a Writer in its constructor.,,[]
"If you choose to extend this class you might as well extend the Writer class directly, and avoid the extra class in the hierarchy.",,[]
Some of the classes in the Java IO API are designed to help you parse input.,"['containment: (java io api, contains, classes)']",[]
The purpose was rather to give you above quick list of classes related to parsing of input data.,,[]
If you have to parse data you will often end up writing your own classes that use some of the classes in this list.,,[]
The Java LineNumberReader class (java.io.LineNumberReader is a BufferedReader that keeps track of line numbers of the read characters.,"['containment: (linenumberreader, is a, bufferedreader)', 'containment: (linenumberreader, is a, java.io)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (linenumberreader, is a, bufferedreader)""]"
You can get the current line number from the LineNumberReader by calling the getLineNumber() method.,"['dependency: (linenumberreader, get the current line number by calling, getlinenumber())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (linenumberreader, get the current line number by calling, getlinenumber())""]"
"You can also set the current line number, should you need to, by calling the setLineNumber() method.",,[]
Since FileOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream this should be no problem.,"['containment: (fileoutputstream, is a subclass of, outputstream)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (fileoutputstream, is a subclass of, outputstream)""]"
In this example the process() method cannot see if the InputStream it gets as parameter comes from the file system or the network (the example only shows the file system version).,,[]
The Java ObjectInputStream class (java.io.ObjectInputStream) enables you to read Java objects from an InputStream instead of just raw bytes.,"['containment: (java.io.objectinputstream, enables reading from, inputstream)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java.io.objectinputstream, enables reading from, inputstream)""]"
"For this ObjectInputStream example to work the object you read must be an instance of MyClass, and must have been serialized into the file ""object.data"" via an ObjectOutputStream.","['dependency: (objectinputstream, must have been serialized via, objectoutputstream)']",[]
Before you can serialize and de-serialize objects the class of the object must implement java.io.Serializable.,,[]
"After that the ObjectInputStream is also closed, and the values read into the Person object are printed to System.out.","['interruption: (objectinputstream, closed, system.out)']",[]
The Java ObjectOutputStream class (java.io.ObjectOutputStream) enables you to write Java objects to an OutputStream instead of just raw bytes.,"['containment: (java.io.objectoutputstream, enables you to write java objects to an outputstream, java.io.objectoutputstream())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (java.io.objectoutputstream, enables you to write java objects to an outputstream, java.io.objectoutputstream())""]"
In this text I will try to give you an overview of the classes in the Java IO (java.io) package.,,[]
"More specifically, I will try to group the classes after their purpose.",,[]
"This grouping should make it easier for you in the future, to determine the purpose of a class, or find the class you need for a specific purpose.",,[]
"Java IO contains many subclasses of the InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer classes.","['containment: (reader, contains subclasses of, writer)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (reader, contains subclasses of, writer)""]"
"The reason is, that all of these subclasses are addressing various different purposes.",,[]
These purposes are nice to know about when reading through the Java IO classes.,,[]
They make it somewhat easier to understand what the classes are targeting.,,[]
"Having discussed sources, destinations, input, output and the various IO purposes targeted by the Java IO classes, here is a table listing most (if not all) Java IO classes divided by input, output, being byte based or character based, and any more specific purpose they may be addressing, like buffering, parsing etc.",,[]
The PipedInputStream class makes it possible to read the contents of a pipe as a stream of bytes.,,[]
The read() method of a PipedInputStream returns an int which contains the byte value of the byte read.,"['containment: (pipedinputstream, contains, read())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (pipedinputstream, contains, read())""]"
"If the read() method returns -1, there is no more data to read in the stream, and it can be closed.",,[]
"Since PipedInputStream is a subclass of InputStream, PipedInputStream has the same basic methods and use patterns as an InputStream.","['similarity: (pipedinputstream, is a subclass of, inputstream)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (pipedinputstream, is a subclass of, inputstream)""]"
The PipedOutputStream class makes it possible to write to a Java pipe as a stream of bytes.,,[]

The Java PipedReader class (java.io.PipedReader) makes it possible to read the contents of a pipe as a stream of characters.,,[]
The read() method of a Java PipedReader returns an int which contains the char value of the character read.,"['containment: (pipedreader, contains method, read())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (pipedreader, contains method, read())""]"

Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the PipedReader instance.,"['interruption: (close(), no longer any explicit call, pipedreader)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (close(), no longer any explicit call, pipedreader)""]"
The Java PipedWriter class (java.io.PipedWriter) makes it possible to write to a Java pipe as a stream of characters.,,[]

Creating a pipe using Java IO is done via the PipedOutputStream and PipedInputStream classes.,"['creation: (pipedoutputstream, creating a pipe, pipedinputstream)']",[]
You can also connect the two pipe streams using their connect() methods.,,[]
Both PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream has a connect() method that can connect one to the other.,"['dependency: (pipedoutputstream, connect to, pipedinputstream)']",[]
"The read() and write() calls on the streams are blocking, meaning if you try to use the same thread to both read and write, this may result in the thread deadlocking itself.","['dependency: (read(), blocking, write())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (read(), blocking, write())""]"
The Java PrintStream class (java.io.PrintStream) enables you to write formatted data to an underlying OutputStream.,"['containment: (java.io.printstream, class_of, java.io)']",[]
"The PrintStream class can format primitive types like int, long etc.",,[]
You may be familiar with these two well-known PrintStream instances in Java: System.out and System.err .,"['similarity: (system.out, well-known printstream instance similar to, system.err)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (system.out, well-known printstream instance similar to, system.err)""]"

The Java PrintWriter class (java.io.PrintWriter) enables you to write formatted data to an underlying Writer.,,[]
The PrintWriter class has all the same methods as the PrintStream except for the methods to write raw bytes.,"['difference: (printwriter, different methods compared to, printstream)']","[""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (printwriter, different methods compared to, printstream)""]"
Being a Writer subclass the PrintWriter is intended to write text.,,[]

The Java Serializable interface (java.io.Serializable is a marker interface your classes must implement if they are to be serialized and deserialized.,,[]
"Therefore, a class implementing Serializable does not have to implement any specific methods.",,[]
Implementing Serializable thus just tells the Java serialization classes that this class is intended for object serialization.,"['implementation: (serializable, tells, java serialization)']",[]
Here is an example of a class that implements the Java Serializable interface:,,[]
"As you can see, the Person class implements the Serializable interface, but does not actually implement any methods.","['implementation: (person, implements, serializable)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (person, implements, serializable)""]"
"In addition to implementing the Serializable interface, a class intended for serialization should also contain a private static final long variable named serialVersionUID.",,[]
"Here is the Person class from before, with a serialVersionUID variable added:",,[]
"The serialVersionUID variable is used by Java's object serialization API to determine if a deserialized object was serialized (written) with the same version of the class, as it is now attempting to deserialize it into.",,[]
Now the serialized Person object may not correspond to the new version of the Person class.,,[]
To detect such problems a class implementing Serializable should contain a serialVersionUID field.,"['containment: (serializable, contain, serialversionuid)']",[]
"If you make big changes to the class, you should also change its serialVersionUID value.",,[]
"These other object serialization mechanisms typically do not require your Java classes to implement Serializable, by the way.",,[]

The class java.io.InputStream is the base class for all Java IO input streams.,,[]
"If you are writing a component that needs to read input from a stream, try to make our component depend on an InputStream, rather than any of it's subclasses (e.g.",,[]

Otherwise your code will not be able to call the unread() method on the PushbackInputStream.,"['dependency: (unread(), call, pushbackinputstream)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (unread(), call, pushbackinputstream)""]"
You typically read data from an InputStream by calling the read() method.,"['dependency: (inputstream, read data, read())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (inputstream, read data, read())""]"
The read() method returns a int containing the byte value of the byte read.,,[]

The class java.io.OutputStream is the base class of all Java IO output streams.,,[]
"If you are writing a component that needs to write output to a stream, try to make sure that component depends on an OutputStream and not one of its subclasses.",,[]
You can even write your own stream classes to wrap the standard stream classes that comes with Java.,,[]
The Java StringReader class enables you to turn an ordinary String into a Reader.,"['conversion: (stringreader, enables conversion into, reader)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (stringreader, enables conversion into, reader)""]"
Closing a Java StringReader can be done using the close() method like this:,"['implementation: (close(), usage, stringreader)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (close(), usage, stringreader)""]"
Notice that there is no explicit close() call on the StringReader.,,[]
The Java StringWriter class (java.io.StringWriter) enables you to obtain the characters written to a Writer as a String.,,[]
Third the characters written to the StringWriter are obtained via the two methods toString() and getBuffer().,"['containment: (stringwriter, obtained via, tostring())', 'containment: (stringwriter, obtained via, getbuffer())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (stringwriter, obtained via, tostring())"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (stringwriter, obtained via, getbuffer())""]"

Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the StringWriter instance.,"['interruption: (close(), no longer call, stringwriter)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (close(), no longer call, stringwriter)""]"
The Java IO API is located in the Java IO package (java.io).,"['containment: (java io api, located in, java.io)']",[]
If you look at the Java IO classes in the java.io package the vast amount of choices can be rather confusing.,,[]

"However, the Java IO package does not contain classes to open network sockets which are necessary for network communication.",,[]
"Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though, you read and write data to and from it via Java IO's InputStream and OutputStream classes.","['implementation: (inputstream, read and write data, outputstream)']",[]
"It contains classes that does much of the same as the Java IO and Java Networking APIs, but Java NIO can work in non-blocking mode.","['difference: (java io, does much of the same as, java networking)', 'similarity: (java io, does much of the same as, java nio)']",[]
The tutorial trail called Java How To's and Utilities also contain a few Java IO utilities - e.g.,,[]

The write() method of an OutputStream takes an int which contains the byte value of the byte to write.,"['containment: (outputstream, contains, write())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (outputstream, contains, write())""]"
This OutputStream write() example first creates a FileOutputStream to which the data will be written.,"['implementation: (outputstream, ""data will be written"", write())']","['(\'class\', \'implementation\', \'method\'): (outputstream, ""data will be written"", write())']"

"The implementation of hasMoreData() is not shown, but imagine that it returns true if there is more data to write, and false if not.",,[]
"Inside the while loop the example calls the method getMoreData() to get the next data to write to the OutputStream, and then writes that data to the OutputStream.","['dependency: (getmoredata(), calls to write data to, outputstream)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (getmoredata(), calls to write data to, outputstream)""]"

The DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetType(int type) method returns true or false depending on whether the given type is supported or not.,,[]
The DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(int concurrency) method returns true or false depending on whether the given concurrency mode is supported or not.,,[]
It is when updateRow() is called that the database is updated with the values of the row.,,[]
"If you call updateRow() inside a transaction, the data is not actually committed to the database until the transaction is committed.",,[]

The DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetHoldability(int holdability) returns true or false depending on whether the given holdability mode is supported or not.,"['implementation: (databasemetadata, supports, supportsresultsetholdability())']",[]

The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses.,,[]
"This Java abstract class tutorial explains how abstract classes are created in Java, what rules apply to them.",,[]
This tutorial gets into the purpose of abstract classes in Java in more detail towards the end of this text.,,[]
In Java you declare that a class is abstract by adding the abstract keyword to the class declaration.,,[]

The utility class is called Arrays and is located in the standard Java package java.util.,"['containment: (arrays, is located in, java.util)']",[]
I will cover a few of the methods found in this class in the following sections.,,[]
"Remember, in order to use java.util.Arrays in your Java classes you must import it.",,[]
Here is how importing java.util.Arrays could look in a Java class of your own:,,[]
It is this statement that imports the class java.util.Arrays into your Java class.,,[]
The second method to copy a Java array is to use the Arrays.copyOf() method.,,[]
The third method to copy a Java array is to use the Arrays.copyOfRange() method.,,[]
"The Arrays.copyOfRange() method copies a range of an array, not necessarily the full array.",,[]
Here is how copying a full array using Arrays.copyOfRange() in Java looks:,,[]
You can convert an Java array of primitive types to a String using the Arrays.toString() method.,,[]
Here is an example of how to convert an array of int to a String using Arrays.toString():,,[]
You can sort the elements of an array using the Arrays.sort() method.,,[]
After the for loop the array is converted to a String using Arrays.toString() and printed out to the console (command line).,,[]
The Arrays.sort() example shown earlier only works for Java arrays of primitive data types.,,[]
Here is first the class for the objects we want to sort:,,[]
The class Employee is a simple model of an employee (I have created the Employee class).,,[]
Here is first an example of sorting an array of Employee objects by their name using the Arrays.sort() method:,,[]
The array is of type Employee - the class I showed you earlier.,,[]
"As parameter to the Arrays.sort() method we pass the employee array, and a Comparator implementation which can determine the order of Employee objects.",,[]
Anonymous implementations of interfaces are covered in my text about nested classes in Java.,,[]
What is important to catch in this example is the implementation of the compare() method of the anonymous inner implementation of the Comparator interface.,"['implementation: (compare(), implementation, comparator)']",[]
In the example above we simply call the String.compare() method which does the comparison for us (compares the employee names).,,[]
"Here is the example from before, with a modified implementation of the compare() method of the anonymous implementation of the Comparator interface:","['modification: (compare(), modified implementation, comparator)']",[]
Notice how the compare() method returns the difference between the employee ids by subtracting one from the other.,,[]
"To compare the Employee objects in the array first by their name, and if that is the same, then by their employee id, the compare() implementation would look like this:",,[]
These Arrays.fill() methods can fill an array with a given value.,,[]
Here is an example of using Arrays.fill() to fill an int array:,,[]
"There is a version of the Arrays.fill() method which takes a from and to index, so only elements with indexes in this interval are filled with the given value.",,[]
"You can do so yourself, or via the Arrays.sort() method covered earlier in this text.",,[]
The binarySearch() method will return the index in the array in which the element was found.,,[]
"If all elements in the array are smaller than the sought value, then binarySearch() will return - length of the array - 1.",,[]
Therefore binarySearch() will return -length (-6) - 1 = -6 -1 = -7.,,[]
The Arrays.binarySearch() method also exists in a version where you just search part of the array.,,[]
"This version of binarySearch() works just like the other version, except in the cases where no matching element is found.",,[]
"If no element is found matching within the index interval, then binarySearch() will still return the index of where the value should have been inserted.",,[]
"But, if all values in the interval are smaller than the sought value, binarySearch() will return -toIndex -1 , and not -array length - 1.",,[]
The java.util.Arrays class contains a set of methods called equals() which can be used to check if two Java arrays are equal.,"['containment: (java.util.arrays, contains methods called, equals())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (java.util.arrays, contains methods called, equals())""]"
"Java classes are some of the core building blocks of Java applications, toolkits, frameworks, APIs etc.",,[]
"A small Java application may consist of a single Java class with a main() method in, as covered in the Java main method tutorial.",,[]
"As your Java application grows, keeping all the code in the same class makes it harder and harder to keep an overview of the code.",,[]
Therefore it might be beneficial to start splitting the Java code up into multiple classes.,,[]

A Java class may contain a mix of data (variables) and actions (methods).,"['containment: (class, contain, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contain, methods)""]"
Grouping variables and operations on these variables into Java classes makes it easier to structure your Java program when it gets too big to fit comfortably inside a single Java class.,,[]
"Therefore, as the class grows, the file you are editing grows too, and becomes harder to keep an overview of in your head.",,[]
"Your Java application will typically have to contain at least a single Java class, but it may contain as many classes as you see fit to divide your application into.",,[]
"Java also comes with a lot of predefined classes for you, so you don't have to code every little function you might desire yourself.",,[]
"Fields are variables (data) that are local to the class, or instances (objects) of that class.",,[]
Methods are operations that the class or instances of that class can perform.,,[]
Nested classes are Java classes that are defined inside another class.,,[]
"Nested classes are typically intended to either be used only internally be the Java class that contains them, or to be used in connection with the class that contains them.",,[]
Nested classes are covered in more detail in my Java nested class tutorial.,,[]
"Sometimes you have classes that only contain fields (data), and sometimes you have classes that only contain methods (operations).",,[]
It depends on what the Java class is supposed to do.,,[]
All it takes to define a class in Java is this:,,[]
The above class definition should be put in its own file named MyClass.java.,,[]
"Java files should be named the same as the name of the class they contain, with the .java as file name extension.",,[]
Make sure you keep the same uppercase and lowercase characters from the class name in the file name too.,,[]
"Only put a single class definition in each Java file, unless your class contains inner classes of some kind.",,[]
"As mentioned earlier, a Java class can contain data in the shape of variables.",,[]

A constructor is a special method that is called when an object of the given class is created (explained later).,"['creation: (method, called when an object of the given, class)']",[]
The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the fields in the class.,,[]
Here is an example of a Java class with two constructors:,,[]

"In other words, the Car class in the previous section is a template for how Car objects look.","['similarity: (car, template for how, car objects)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (car, template for how, car objects)""]"
"To create objects of a certain class, you use the new keyword.",,[]

"Thus, the fields of different objects (even of the same class) can vary independently of each other.",,[]
"After creating the 3 Car objects, the setColor() method is called on each object.",,[]
"Creating an object of a certain class is also called ""instantiating"" an object.",,[]
"The object is thus also called an ""instance"" of the given class.",,[]
"For instance, each of the Car objects above are also called an instance of the Car class, or simply ""Car instances"".",,[]
What you have seen in this text only covers the very basics of Java classes.,,[]
"You need to learn about fields, constructors, methods nested classes, abstract classes, inheritance, access modifiers and interfaces too.",,[]
"Here is a simple example that creates an object, which results in the class constructor being called:",,[]
The example shows a very simple Java class with a single constructor.,,[]
The second part of a Java constructor declaration is the name of the class the constructor belongs to.,,[]
Using the class name for the constructor signals to the Java compiler that this is a constructor.,,[]
The constructor parameters are declared inside the parentheses () after the class name part of the constructor .,"['containment: (constructor, declared inside, class)']",[]
"A class can have multiple constructors, as long as their signature (the parameters they take) are not the same.",,[]
"When a Java class contains multiple constructors, we say that the constructor is overloaded (comes in multiple versions).",,[]
"This is what constructor overloading means, that a Java class contains multiple constructors.",,[]
The keyword this in front of the field name (this.number) is not necessary.,,[]
"You don't have to define a constructor for a class, but if you don't define any constructor, the Java compiler will insert a default, no-argument constructor for you.","['creation: (java compiler, insert a default no-argument constructor, constructor)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (java compiler, insert a default no-argument constructor, constructor)""]"
"Thus, once the class is compiled it will always at least have a no-argument constructor.","['creation: (class, compiled it will always at least have, constructor)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (class, compiled it will always at least have, constructor)""]"
"If you do define a constructor for your class, then the Java compiler will not insert the default no-argument constructor into your class.","['dependency: (constructor, define a constructor for your, class)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (constructor, define a constructor for your, class)""]"
The parameters are passed to the constructor inside the parentheses after the class name on the right side of the equal sign.,,[]
"By default, if a parameter (or local variable) has the same name as a field in the same class, the parameter (or local variable) ""shadows"" for the field.",,[]
"Inside the constructor of the Employee class the firstName, lastName and birthYear identifiers now refer to the constructor parameters, not to the Employee fields with the same names.",,[]
"To signal to the Java compiler that you mean the fields of the Employee class and not the parameters, put the this keyword and a dot in front of the field name.",,[]
You call a constructor when you create a new instance of the class containing the constructor.,"['creation: (constructor, create a new instance of, class)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (constructor, create a new instance of, class)""]"
"In case you want to pass parameters to the constructor, you include the parameters between the parentheses after the class name, like this:",,[]
The this keyword followed by parentheses and parameters means that another constructor in the same Java class is being called.,"['dependency: (this, another constructor being called, constructor)']",[]
In this example it is the first constructor in the class that is being called.,,[]
"When a class extends another class it is also said to ""inherit"" from the class it extends.",,[]
"The class that extends is called the subclass, and the class being extended is called the superclass.","['modification: (class, extends, subclass)', 'modification: (subclass, being extended, superclass)']",[]
A class that extends another class does not inherit its constructors.,,[]
"However, the subclass must call a constructor in the superclass inside of its the subclass constructors!","['dependency: (subclass, call a constructor, superclass)']",[]
"If a subclass calls another constructor within itself, then the called constructor must call the superclass constructor.",,[]
It calls the constructor in the superclass using this Java statement:,,[]
Using the keyword super refers to the superclass of the class using the super keyword.,,[]
"When super keyword is followed by parentheses like it is here, it refers to a constructor in the superclass.","['dependency: (super(), refers to, constructor)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (super(), refers to, constructor)""]"
In this case it refers to the constructor in the Vehicle class.,"['containment: (vehicle, refers to, constructor)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (vehicle, refers to, constructor)""]"
The access modifier of a constructor determines what classes in your application that are allowed to call that constructor.,,[]
"For instance, if a constructor is declared protected then only classes in the same package, or subclasses of that class can call that constructor.","['dependency: (constructor, can call, class)', 'dependency: (constructor, call, package)', 'dependency: (constructor, call, subclasses)', 'containment: (class, in, package)', 'containment: (class, in, subclasses)', 'containment: (package, of, subclasses)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (constructor, can call, class)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'package'): (constructor, call, package)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (constructor, call, subclasses)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class, in, subclasses)""]"

"Thus, some constructors may be available to all classes in your application, while other constructors are only available to classes in the same package, subclasses, or even only to the class itself (private constructors).","['containment: (constructors, available to, classes)', 'containment: (constructors, available to, package)']",[]
Here is an example of a Java class with a constructor that can throw an exception:,,[]
Making a constructor throw an exception can be a good idea if you want to prevent an object of the given class to be created in an invalid state.,[],[]
"A class can have fields, constructors and methods (plus more, but that is not important now).","['containment: (class, can have, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, can have, methods)""]"
"When you create an object, that object is of a certain class.",,[]
The class is like a template (or blueprint) telling how objects of that class should look.,,[]
"When you create an object, you say ""give me an object of this class"".","['creation: (object, is created as an instance of, class)']",[]
"If you think of a factory producing lots and lots of the same items, then the class would be the blueprint / manual of how the finished product should look, and the objects would be each of the finished products.",,[]
"If the factory produced cars, then the blueprint / design manual of the cars to produce corresponds to a Java class, and the physical cars produced corresponds to Java objects.",,[]
Here is a simple diagram illustrating the principle of objects being of a certain class.,,[]
The class determines what fields and methods the objects of that class have.,"['containment: (class, determines what, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, determines what, methods)""]"
"The Car class does not contain any fields, constructors or methods.",,[]
The example primarily serves to show you an example of how a class declaration looks in Java code.,,[]
A field is a variable that belongs to a class or an object.,,[]
"For instance, a Car class could define the field brand which all Car objects would have.","['containment: (car, defines, brand)']",[]
Here is the Car class declaration from above with a field name brand added:,,[]
Constructors are a special kind of method that is executed when an object of that class is created.,"['creation: (method, executed when an object of, class)']",[]
Here is the Car class from before with a constructor that initializes the brand field:,,[]
"Here is the Car class from before with a single, simple method named getBrand added:","['implementation: (car, includes method, getbrand)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (car, includes method, getbrand)""]"
"When a class implements an interface, the class has to implement all the methods described in the interface.","['implementation: (class, implements, interface)', 'implementation: (class, implements, methods)', 'containment: (interface, describes, methods)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interface)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (class, implements, methods)""]"
"Packages provides a handy way of grouping related classes and interfaces, thus making modularization of your Java code easier.","['containment: (packages, grouping, classes)', 'containment: (packages, grouping, interfaces)']",[]
"That these are primitive data types means that they are not objects, nor references to objects (classes and objects are explained in later texts in this Java tutorial).",,[]
You can also create your own more complex data types by creating custom classes.,,[]
"More precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class.","['similarity: (java enum type, is a special kind of, java class)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (java enum type, is a special kind of, java class)""]"
Notice the enum keyword which is used in place of class or interface.,,[]
Replace the ... with the code to execute if the level variable matches the given Level constant value.,,[]
You can obtain an array of all the possible values of a Java enum type by calling its static values() method.,,[]
All enum types get a static values() method automatically by the Java compiler.,,[]
An enum class automatically gets a toString() method in the class when compiled.,"['containment: (enum class, automatically gets a, tostring() method)']",[]
The toString() method returns a string value of the name of the given enum instance.,,[]
"Then the toString() method will get called behind the scenes, so the value that will be printed out is the textual name of the enum instance.",,[]
An enum class automatically gets a static valueOf() method in the class when compiled.,,[]
The valueOf() method can be used to obtain an instance of the enum class for a given String value.,"['conversion: (valueof(), obtain an instance of, enum)']",[]
The level variable will point to the Level.HIGH after executing this line.,,[]
It is possible for a Java enum class to have abstract methods too.,"['containment: (enum, have, abstract methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (enum, have, abstract methods)""]"
"If an enum class has an abstract method, then each instance of the enum class must implement it.","['implementation: (enum class, implements, method)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (enum class, implements, method)""]"
Notice the abstract method declaration at the bottom of the enum class.,"['containment: (enum class, contains, method declaration)']",[]
It is the method getDescription() that comes from the interface MyInterface.,"['containment: (getdescription(), comes from, myinterface)']",[]
"Java enums extend the java.lang.Enum class implicitly, so your enum types cannot extend another class.",,[]
"The purpose of this exercise is to verify that you know how to create classes, how to create instance variables inside the classes, how to create an array of objects and how to iterate that array while referencing the objects in it.","['- creation: (classes, creation_of, instance variables)', '- containment: (classes, contain, array)', '- containment: (array, contain, objects)', '- iteration: (array, iterate_over, objects)']",[]
"For instance, in a class representing an employee, the Employee class might contain the following fields:",,[]
The access modifier determines which object classes that can access the field.,,[]
"In Java, static fields belongs to the class, not instances of the class.",,[]
"Thus, all instances of any class will access the same static field variable.",,[]
A non-static field value can be different for every object (instance) of a class.,,[]
The Java field access modifier determines whether the field can be accessed by classes other than the the class owning the field.,,[]
The private access modifier means that only code inside the class itself can access this Java field.,,[]
"The package access modifier means that only code inside the class itself, or other classes in the same package, can access the field.","['containment: (class, access modifier, package)']",[]
"The protected access modifier is like the package modifier, except subclasses of the class can also access the field, even if the subclass is not located in the same package.","['containment: (class, includes, field)', 'containment: (subclass, includes, field)', 'containment: (package, contains, class)', 'containment: (package, contains, subclass)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class, includes, field)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (subclass, includes, field)""]"
The public access modifier means that the field can be accessed by all classes in your application.,,[]
You would probably not use all access modifiers in the same class.,,[]
"For simple, data carrying classes you may declare all fields public.",,[]
"Thus, no matter how many objects you create of that class, there will only exist one field located in the class, and the value of that field is the same, no matter from which object it is accessed.",,[]
"Static fields are located in the class, so you don't need an instance of the class to access static fields.",,[]
"Non-static Java fields, on the other hand, are located in the instances of the class.",,[]
Each instance of the class can have its own values for these fields.,,[]
To access a non-static field you need an instance of the class (an object) on which you can access it.,,[]
"That means, that even if the field belongs to objects (class instances), you cannot vary the value of the field from object to object.",,[]
"That way it only exists in the class, not in every object too.",,[]
"The first line creates a new Customer object (an instance of the Customer class), and stores it in a variable called customer.",,[]
A class is loaded the first time it is referenced in your program.,,[]
"Inside the parentheses () after the for keyword, are three statements separated by semicolon (;).",,[]
"In this example, only the first System.out.println() statement is executed inside the for loop.",,[]
The second System.out.println() statement is not executed until after the for loop is finished.,,[]
"Second, inside the isValid() method the String.equals() method is used to test for equality to a certain string value.",,[]
The isValid() method could actually have been written in a shorter way.,,[]

Java inheritance refers to the ability in Java for one class to inherit from another class.,"['containment: (inheritance, inherit from, class)']",[]
One class can extend another class and thereby inherit from that class.,"['inheritance: (class, inherit from, class)', 'extension: (class, extend, class)']",[]
"When one class inherits from another class in Java, the two classes take on certain roles.","['containment: (class, inherits from, classes)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class, inherits from, classes)""]"
The class that extends (inherits from another class) is the subclass and the class that is being extended (the class being inherited from) is the superclass .,"['containment: (subclass, extends, superclass)']",[]
"A subclass is a specialization of a superclass, and a superclass is a generalization of one or more subclasses.","['similarity: (subclass, specialization, superclass)', 'similarity: (superclass, generalization, subclass)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (subclass, specialization, superclass)"", ""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (superclass, generalization, subclass)""]"
"Inheritance can be an effective method to share code between classes that have some traits in common, yet allowing the classes to have some parts that are different.",,[]
"Here is diagram illustrating a class called Vehicle, which has two subclasses called Car and Truck.","['containment: (vehicle, has subclass, truck)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (vehicle, has subclass, truck)""]"
The Vehicle class can contain those fields and methods that all Vehicles need (e.g.,,[]
Note: Some people will claim that inheritance is a way to categorize your classes based on what they are.,,[]
"In practice, however, that is not how you determine which superclasses and subclasses your application needs to have.",,[]
Then it makes sense to have a common Vehicle superclass for the two classes.,,[]
"If you never process Car and Truck objects in the same way, there is no point in having a common superclass for them, except perhaps to share code between them (to avoid writing duplicate code).",,[]
Superclasses and subclasses form an inheritance structure which is also called a class hierarchy.,,[]
At the top of the class hierarchy you have the superclasses.,,[]
At the bottom of the class hierarchy you have the subclasses.,,[]
"A class hierarchy may have multiple levels, meaning multiple levels of superclasses and subclasses.","['containment: (class, have multiple levels, superclasses)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class, have multiple levels, superclasses)""]"
A subclass may itself be a superclass of other subclasses etc.,,[]
"When a class inherits from a superclass, it inherits parts of the superclass methods and fields.","['containment: (class, inherits, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, inherits, methods)""]"
"When a subclass extends a superclass in Java, all protected and public fields and methods of the superclass are inherited by the subclass.","['containment: (superclass, inherits fields and methods, subclass)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (superclass, inherits fields and methods, subclass)""]"
"By inherited is meant that these fields and methods are part of of the subclass, as if the subclass had declared them itself.","['containment: (subclass, part of, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (subclass, part of, methods)""]"
protected and public fields can be called and referenced just like the methods declared directly in the subclass.,,[]
Fields and methods with default (package) access modifiers can be accessed by subclasses only if the subclass is located in the same package as the superclass.,,[]
Private fields and methods of the superclass can never be referenced directly by subclasses.,"['containment: (superclass, fields and methods cannot be referenced directly by, subclasses)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (superclass, fields and methods cannot be referenced directly by, subclasses)""]"

"Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but a subclass constructor must call a constructor in the superclass.",,[]
The Java inheritance mechanism only allows a Java class to inherit from a single superclass (singular inheritance).,,[]

"the superclasses contain methods with the same names and parameters, multiple inheritance was left out in Java.","['containment: (methods, contain same names and parameters, inheritance)']",[]
You declare that one class extends another class by using the extends keyword in the class definition.,,[]
"The Car class in this example extends the Vehicle class, meaning the Car class inherits from the Vehicle class.","['implementation: (car, inherits from, vehicle)']",[]
"Because the Car class extends the Vehicle class, the protected field licensePlate from the Vehicle class is inherited by the Car class.","['containment: (car, extends, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (car, extends, vehicle)""]"

I just placed the getLicensePlate() method in the Car class to show that it is possible.,"['containment: (getlicenseplate(), placed in, car)']",[]
It is possible to reference a subclass as an instance of one of its superclasses.,,[]
"For instance, using the class definitions from the example in the previous section it is possible to reference an instance of the Car class as an instance of the Vehicle class.","['similarity: (car, instance of, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (car, instance of, vehicle)""]"

Here is a Java code example: Car car = new Car(); Vehicle vehicle = car; First a Car instance is created.,,[]
This is possible because the Car class inherits from the Vehicle class.,"['containment: (car, inherits from, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (car, inherits from, vehicle)""]"
"As you can see, it is possible to use an instance of some subclass as if it were an instance of its superclass.",,[]
"That way, you don't need to know exactly what subclass the object is an instance of.",,[]
The process of referencing an object of class as a different type than the class itself is called type casting.,,[]
Upcasting and Downcasting You can always cast an object of a subclass to one of its superclasses.,,[]
This is referred to as upcasting (from a subclass type to a superclass type).,,[]
"It may also be possible to cast an object from a superclass type to a subclass type, but only if the object really is an instance of that subclass (or an instance of a subclass of that subclass).",,[]
This is referred to as downcasting (from a superclass type to a subclass type).,,[]
"Thus, this example of downcasting is valid: Car car = new Car(); // upcast to Vehicle Vehicle vehicle = car; // downcast to car again Car car2 = (Car) vehicle; However, the following downcast example is not valid.",,[]
"Truck truck = new Truck(); // upcast to Vehicle Vehicle vehicle = truck; // downcast to car again Car car = (Car) vehicle; The Truck object can be upcast to a Vehicle object, but it cannot be downcast to a Car object later.","['conversion: (truck, upcast to, vehicle)', 'conversion: (vehicle, downcast to, car)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (truck, upcast to, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (vehicle, downcast to, car)""]"
Overriding Methods In a subclass you can override (redefine) methods defined in the superclass.,"['modification: (subclass, override methods defined in, superclass)']",[]
Here is a Java method override example: public class Vehicle { String licensePlate = null; public void setLicensePlate(String licensePlate) { this.licensePlate = licensePlate; } } public class Car extends Vehicle { public void setLicensePlate(String license) { this.licensePlate = license.toLowerCase(); } } Notice how both the Vehicle class and the Car class defines a method called setLicensePlate().,"['similarity: (vehicle, defines similar method to, car)', 'modification: (car, alters method behavior in, setlicenseplate())']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (vehicle, defines similar method to, car)""]"

To override a method the method signature in the subclass must be the same as in the superclass.,"['modification: (method, signature override, method)']","[""('method', 'modification', 'method'): (method, signature override, method)""]"
"That means that the method definition in the subclass must have exactly the same name and the same number and type of parameters, and the parameters must be listed in the exact same sequence as in the superclass.","['similarity: (method, same name and type as, superclass)', 'similarity: (method, same name and type as, subclass)', 'dependency: (method, definition follows parameters of, superclass)', 'dependency: (method, definition follows parameters of, subclass)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (method, definition follows parameters of, superclass)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (method, definition follows parameters of, subclass)""]"
Otherwise the method in the subclass will be considered a separate method.,,[]

The instanceof instruction can determine whether a given object is an instance of some class.,,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example: Car car = new Car(); boolean isCar = car instanceof Car; After this code has been executed the isCar variable will contain the value true.,,[]
The instanceof instruction can also be used determine if an object is a instance of a superclass of its class.,,[]
"Here is an instanceof example that checks if a Car object is an instance of Vehicle: Car car = new Car(); boolean isVehicle = car instanceof Vehicle; Assuming that the Car class extends (inherits from) the Vehicle class, the isVehicle variable will contain the value true after this code is executed.",,[]

Nested Classes and Inheritance The same Java inheritance rules apply to nested classes.,,[]
Nested classes with the default (package) access modifier are only accessible to subclasses if the subclass is located in the same package as the superclass.,,[]
Nested classes with the protected or public access modifier are always inherited by subclasses.,,[]
Here is a nested class inheritance example: class MyClass { class MyNestedClass { } } public class MySubclass extends MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) { MySubclass subclass = new MySubclass(); MyNestedClass nested = subclass.new MyNestedClass(); } } Notice how it is possible to create an instance of the nested class MyNestedClass which is defined in the superclass (MyClass) via a reference to the subclass (MySubclass).,"['creation: (myclass, contains nested, mynestedclass)', 'creation: (mysubclass, instantiates, mynestedclass)', 'containment: (myclass, contains methods, main)', 'containment: (myclass, superclass of, mysubclass)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (myclass, contains methods, main)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (myclass, superclass of, mysubclass)""]"
Here is now that looks: public final class MyClass { } A final class cannot be extended.,,[]
"In other words, you cannot inherit from a final class in Java.",,[]
Abstract Classes and Inheritance In Java a class can be declared abstract.,,[]
I have explained abstract classes in more detail in my Java abstract classes tutorial.,,[]
An abstract class is a class that does not contain the full implementation of whatever the abstract class should do.,,[]
"In other words, you cannot create objects of an abstract class.",,[]
In Java abstract classes are intended to be extended to create a full implementation.,,[]
The Java inheritance rules are the same for abstract classes as for non-abstract classes.,,[]
You can always cast an object of a subclass to one of its superclasses.,"['conversion: (subclass, cast, superclass)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (subclass, cast, superclass)""]"
In a subclass you can override (redefine) methods defined in the superclass.,,[]
Notice how both the Vehicle class and the Car class defines a method called setLicensePlate().,,[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.","['modification: (superclass, signature changed, method)', 'interruption: (subclass, no longer overrides, superclass)']",[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, but still need to call the method defined in the superclass, you can do so using the super reference, like this:",,[]
"In the above code example the method setLicensePlate() in the Car class, calls the setLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class.","['dependency: (setlicenseplate(), calls, car)', 'dependency: (setlicenseplate(), calls, vehicle)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (setlicenseplate(), calls, car)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (setlicenseplate(), calls, vehicle)""]"
"Assuming that the Car class extends (inherits from) the Vehicle class, the isVehicle variable will contain the value true after this code is executed.","['implementation: (car, inherits from, vehicle)']",[]
"As mentioned earlier, in Java fields cannot be overridden in a subclass.",,[]
Here is Java inheritance example that illustrates how fields in subclasses shadow (hides) fields in superclasses:,,[]
"If a class does not have any explicit constructor defined, the Java compiler inserts an implicit no-arg constructor.",,[]
"Second, if a constructor does not explicitly call a constructor in the superclass, the Java compiler inserts an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.",,[]
That means that the following version of the Car class is actually equivalent to the version shown earlier:,,[]
"In fact, since the constructor is now empty, we could leave it out and the Java compiler would insert it, and insert an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.","['dependency: (constructor, leave it out, java compiler)', 'implementation: (java compiler, insert it, constructor)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (constructor, leave it out, java compiler)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (java compiler, insert it, constructor)""]"
"Even though no constructors are declared in these two classes, they both get a no-arg constructor, and the no-arg constructor in the Car class will call the no-arg constructor in the Vehicle class.","['creation: (car, get a no-arg constructor, constructor)', 'dependency: (car, call the no-arg constructor in, vehicle)', 'creation: (vehicle, get a no-arg constructor, constructor)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (car, get a no-arg constructor, constructor)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (vehicle, get a no-arg constructor, constructor)""]"
Notice how it is possible to create an instance of the nested class MyNestedClass which is defined in the superclass (MyClass) via a reference to the subclass (MySubclass).,"['creation: (mynestedclass, instance creation via, mysubclass)', 'containment: (mynestedclass, defined in, myclass)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (mynestedclass, defined in, myclass)""]"
"The Java instanceof operator can determine if a given Java object is an instance of a given class, superclass or interface.","['implementation: (instanceof, determine if an instance of, java object)', 'implementation: (instanceof, determine if an instance of, class)', 'implementation: (instanceof, determine if an instance of, superclass)', 'implementation: (instanceof, determine if an instance of, interface)']",[]
The Java instanceof operator is also referred to as a type comparison operator because it compares the type of a given instance (object) with a specific type (class or interface).,"['difference: (class, type of a given instance, interface)']",[]
"The expression map instanceof Object will evaluate to true if the map variable references an object that is an instance of class Object, or any subclass of class Object.",,[]
"Since all classes in Java inherit from Object, this expression will evaluate to true.",,[]
"As mentioned earlier, the Java instanceof operator will evaluate to true if you compare an object to the exact class of that object.",,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example showing a comparison of an object to its exact class:,,[]
"As also mentioned earlier, the Java instanceof operator also evaluates to true when comparing an object against a superclass of the type of that object.",,[]
"Since HashMap is a subclass of Object - even if not a direct subclass, the expression map instanceof Object evaluates to true.","['containment: (hashmap, is a subclass of, object)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (hashmap, is a subclass of, object)""]"
"Note, that it does not matter how high up in the inheritance hierarchy the compared type is superclass of the type of the object.",,[]
"As long as the type compared to is a superclass somewhere up the inheritance hierarchy, instanceof will evaluate to true.",,[]
The Java instanceof operator also works when comparing an object against an interface instead of a class.,"['similarity: (instanceof, works when comparing against, interface)']",[]
"Notice, that even if the map variable is of type HashMap, the instanceof operator returns true for the expression map instanceof Map because the HashMap class implements the Map interface.","['implementation: (hashmap, implements, map)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (hashmap, implements, map)""]"
"The Java instanceof operator also evaluates to true when comparing an object against a superinterface which the class of the object, or a superclass of the object implements.",,[]
"The TreeMap class implements SortedMap, and thus also indirectly the Map interface.","['implementation: (treemap, implements, sortedmap)', 'implementation: (treemap, indirectly implements, map)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (treemap, implements, sortedmap)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (treemap, indirectly implements, map)""]"
The Java instanceof operator always evaluates to false when a null variable is compared against any class or interface.,,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,,[]
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.","['difference: (class, compared against, interface)']",[]
"Since a Java String object can never be an instance of the Java Integer class, the Java compiler will catch this an give you an error.","['difference: (string, never be an instance of, integer)']","[""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (string, never be an instance of, integer)""]"
That means that the actual class of the referenced object could be pretty much any class (since all classes are subclasses of Object).,,[]
"In short, we can avoid the explicit downcast of an object when comparing it against a subclass.",,[]
Notice the str variable after the String class name in the instanceof expression inside the if-statement.,,[]
"Since the right hand side of the expression is only evaluated if the left hand side evaluates to true, this cannot result in startsWith() being called on a non-String object.",,[]
"A question I get a lot is what the difference is between Java interfaces and abstract classes, and when to use each.","['difference: (java interfaces, difference, abstract classes)']","[""('interface', 'difference', 'class'): (java interfaces, difference, abstract classes)""]"
"Having answered this question by email multiple times, I decided to write this tutorial about Java interfaces vs abstract classes.",,[]
"In other words, to make the classes using the interface independent of the classes implementing the interface.",,[]
"Thus, you can exchange the implementation of the interface, without having to change the class using the interface.","['alternative: (interface, exchange, class)']",[]
Abstract classes are typically used as base classes for extension by subclasses.,,[]
"Some programming languages use abstract classes to achieve polymorphism, and to separate interface from implementation, but in Java you use interfaces for that.","['difference: (abstract classes, achieve polymorphism, interfaces)', 'alternative: (abstract classes, separate interface from implementation, interfaces)']",[]
"Remember, a Java class can only have 1 superclass, but it can implement multiple interfaces.","['implementation: (class, can implement, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, can implement, interface)""]"
"Thus, if a class already has a different superclass, it can implement an interface, but it cannot extend another abstract class.","['implementation: (class, can implement, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, can implement, interface)""]"
"If you also need to provide a base class or default implementation of the interface, add an abstract class (or normal class) that implements the interface.","['implementation: (abstract class, implements, interface)', 'implementation: (class, implements, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (abstract class, implements, interface)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interface)""]"

"However, it is possible to provide default implememntations of a method in a Java interface, to make the implementation of the interface easier for classes implementing the interface.","['implementation: (method, default implementations, interface)']",[]
"Just like with classes, a Java interface can be declared public or package scope (no access modifier).","['containment: (java, declared as, package)']",[]
"As you can see, accessing a variable from an interface is very similar to accessing a static variable in a class.","['similarity: (interface, accessing a variable from an interface is similar to accessing a static variable, class)']",[]
"The method, however, needs to be implemented by some class before you can access it.",,[]
"Before you can really use an interface, you must implement that interface in some Java class.","['implementation: (interface, implement, java class)']","[""('interface', 'implementation', 'class'): (interface, implement, java class)""]"
Here is a class that implements the MyInterface interface shown above:,,[]
This signals to the Java compiler that the MyInterfaceImpl class implements the MyInterface interface.,"['implementation: (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)""]"
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.,"['implementation: (class, implements, interface)', 'containment: (class, implements, methods)', 'containment: (interface, declared, methods)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interface)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, implements, methods)""]"
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,"['implementation: (class, does not need to implement, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, does not need to implement, interface)""]"
Once a Java class implements an Java interface you can use an instance of that class as an instance of that interface.,"['conversion: (java class instance, used as, java interface instance)']",[]
Java allows this because the class MyInterfaceImpl implements the MyInterface interface.,"['implementation: (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)""]"
You can then reference instances of the MyInterfaceImpl class as instances of the MyInterface interface.,"['implementation: (myinterfaceimpl, reference, myinterface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (myinterfaceimpl, reference, myinterface)""]"
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.","['implementation: (class, implements, interface)', 'creation: (class, create an instance of, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interface)""]"
In that case the class must implement all the methods declared in all the interfaces implemented.,"['implementation: (class, implements methods of, methods)', 'implementation: (class, implements, interfaces)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (class, implements methods of, methods)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interfaces)""]"
"If the interfaces are not located in the same packages as the implementing class, you will also need to import the interfaces.","['containment: (interfaces, located in, packages)', 'dependency: (implementing class, need to import, interfaces)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (implementing class, need to import, interfaces)""]"
Java interfaces are imported using the import instruction just like Java classes.,,[]
Here are the two Java interfaces implemented by the class above:,,[]
"If a Java class implements multiple Java interfaces, there is a risk that some of these interfaces may contain methods with the same signature (name + parameters).","['containment: (interfaces, contain, methods)', 'containment: (methods, have, signature)']","[""('method', 'containment', 'method'): (methods, have, signature)""]"
"Since a Java class can only implement at method with a given signature once, this could potentially lead to some problems.","['implementation: (class, implement at method with a given signature, method)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (class, implement at method with a given signature, method)""]"
"Especially if those constants are to be used by the classes implementing the interface, e.g.","['implementation: (interface, to be used by, class)']","[""('interface', 'implementation', 'class'): (interface, to be used by, class)""]"
It is up to the classes implementing the interface to specify an implementation.,,[]
"If the API just adds the method to the desired interface, all classes that implements the interface must implement that new method.","['modification: (method, adds to, interface)', 'implementation: (classes, implements, interface)', 'dependency: (classes, must implement, method)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (classes, implements, interface)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (classes, must implement, method)""]"
That is fine if all implementing classes are located within the API.,,[]
"But if some implementing classes are located in client code of the API (the code that uses the API), then that code breaks.",,[]
Look at this interface and imagine that it is part of e.g.,,[]
"If the developer of the API wants to add one more method to the ResourceLoader interface, then the FileLoader class will be broken when that project upgrades to the new version of the API.","['modification: (resourceloader, be modified by adding a method, fileloader)', 'dependency: (fileloader, be broken when project upgrades, resourceloader)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (fileloader, be broken when project upgrades, resourceloader)""]"
"A class can override the implementation of a default method simply by implementing that method explicitly, as is done normally when implementing a Java interface.","['implementation: (class, implementing, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implementing, interface)""]"
Any implementation in a class takes precedence over interface default method implementations.,"['preference: (class, takes precedence over, interface)', 'implementation: (class, takes precedence over, method)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (class, takes precedence over, method)""]"
Calling a static method in an interface looks and works just like calling a static method in a class.,"['similarity: (method, calling a static method looks and works just like calling a static method, interface)', 'similarity: (method, calling a static method looks and works just like calling a static method, class)']",[]
Here is an example of calling the static print() method from the above MyInterface interface:,"['dependency: (print(), calling, myinterface)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (print(), calling, myinterface)""]"
"It is possible for a Java interface to inherit from another Java interface, just like classes can inherit from other classes.","['similarity: (classes, inherit from, classes)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (classes, inherit from, classes)""]"
"That then means, that if a class implements MySubInterface, that class has to implement all methods defined in both MySubInterface and MySuperInterface.","['implementation: (mysubinterface, requires implementation from, mysuperinterface)']",[]
A class implementing an interface which inherits from multiple interfaces must implement all methods from the interface and its superinterfaces.,[],[]
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.","['containment: (class, implement, interface)', 'containment: (interface, contain, method)', 'interruption: (class, implement not possible if, method)', 'similarity: (method, have same signature as, method)']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (method, have same signature as, method)""]"
"In other words, if two interfaces contain the same method signature (name + parameters) and one of the interfaces declare this method as a default method, a class cannot automatically implement both interfaces.","['difference: (method, declare as a default method, method)']",[]
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,"['containment: (method, implementing part of, interface)']",[]
That way there is no doubt about which implementation the class will have.,,[]
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,,[]
"Basically, polymorphism means that an instance of an class (an object) can be used as if it were of different types.",,[]
"The classes above are all parts of a model representing different types of vehicles and drivers, with fields and methods.",,[]
That is the responsibility of these classes - to model these entities from real life.,,[]
"Please forget for a while, that implementing this functionality as methods directly on the objects may lead to a messy class hierarchy.",,[]
"Where in the above diagram would you put these three methods, so they are accessible on all classes?",,[]

"When each class implements these two interfaces and their methods, you can access the methods of these interfaces by casting the objects to instances of the interface types.",,[]
"You don't need to know exactly what class a given object is of, as long as you know what interface it implements.","['implementation: (class, implements, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (class, implements, interface)""]"

A generic Java interface is an interface which can be typed - meaning it can be specialized to work with a specific type (e.g.,,[]
This interface represents an interface which contains a single method called produce() which can produce a single object.,,[]
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.","['creation: (produce(), return value, object)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (produce(), return value, object)""]"

"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.",,[]

"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.","['implementation: (carproducer, no longer necessary to cast, car)', 'implementation: (carproducer, returns the same type, myproducer)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (carproducer, returns the same type, myproducer)""]"

A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class.,,[]
Imagine you have a class called StateOwner which can register state event listeners.,,[]
The lambda expression is matched against the parameter type of the addStateListener() method's parameter.,,[]
"For instance, the interface type of the parameter can be inferred from the method declaration of the addStateListener() method (the single method on the StateChangeListener interface).","['dependency: (addstatelistener, inferred from, statechangelistener)']",[]

"In this case, these parameters have to match the parameters of the onStateChange() method of the StateChangeListener interface:","['implementation: (onstatechange(), parameters match the parameters of, statechangelistener)']",[]
Here is an example class that creates a lambda which references a static variable from inside the lambda body:,,[]
The class primarily serves to show you that a lambda can access static variables.,,[]
"Since all the lambda body does is forward the string parameter to the System.out.println() method, we can replace the above lambda declaration with a method reference.",,[]
Whatever class or object that owns the referenced method comes before the double colons.,,[]
"Since the parameters of the Finder.find() and MyClass.doFind() methods match, it is possible to create a lambda expression that implements Finder.find() and references the MyClass.doFind() method.","['implementation: (finder.find(), implements, myclass.dofind())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (finder.find(), implements, myclass.dofind())""]"
Here is an example of a Java lambda expression that calls String.indexOf() to search:,,[]
The convertToInt() method has the same signature as the deserialize() method of the Deserializer deserialize() method.,"['similarity: (converttoint(), same signature as, deserialize())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (converttoint(), same signature as, deserialize())""]"

Finally it is possible to reference a constructor of a class.,"['containment: (constructor, reference, class)']",[]
"You do that by writing the class name followed by ::new, like this:",,[]
The create() method of this interface matches the signature of one of the constructors in the String class.,"['creation: (create(), matches the signature of one of the constructors in, string)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (create(), matches the signature of one of the constructors in, string)""]"
"In Java, all instructions (code) have to be located inside a Java class.",,[]
A class is a way of grouping data and instructions that belong together.,,[]
"Declaring a simple class without any variables, methods or any other instructions, looks like this in Java code:",,[]
This Java code needs to be located in a file with the same file name as the class and ending with the file suffix .java.,,[]

"You can choose the name of the class to execute, but not the name of the method.","['difference: (class, choose the name, method)']",[]
Here is how the main method declaration looks when located inside the Java class declaration from earlier:,,[]
Just remember that a main() method declaration needs these three keywords.,,[]
"In the main() method example earlier I called the String array parameter args, and in the second example I called it stringArray.",,[]
"You call the java command that comes with the JRE, and tells it what Java class to execute, and what arguments to pass to the main() method.",,[]
The second and third arguments (-cp classes) tells the JVM in what directory the compiled Java classes are located (cp means class path).,,[]
In this case the compiled Java classes are located in a directory named classes.,,[]
The fourth argument is the name of the Java class the JVM is to execute.,,[]
"Notice how the class name also contains the name of the package the class is located in (the ""fully qualified class name"").","['containment: (class, located in, package)']",[]
You can pass arguments from the command line to the main() method.,,[]

The main() method can access the arguments from the command line like this:,,[]
"If only a single Java class in your Java program contains a main() method, then the class containing the main() method is often referred to as the main class.","['containment: (main(), contained in, main class)']",[]
You can have as many classes as you want in your project with a main() method in.,,[]
You can still call the other main() methods from inside the main() method the Java Virtual Machine executes (you haven't seen how yet) and you can also start up multiple virtual machines which each execute a single main() method.,"['dependency: (main(), calls, main())', 'dependency: (main(), calls, main())', 'creation: (main(), start up multiple virtual machines, main())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (main(), calls, main())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (main(), calls, main())""]"

The Java Math class provides more advanced mathematical calculations than what the basic Java math operators provide.,,[]

"The java.lang.Math contains a set of basic math functions for obtaining the absolute value, highest and lowest of two values, rounding of values, random values etc.",,[]
These basic math functions of the Java Math class will be covered in the following sections.,,[]
The Math.abs() function returns the absolute value of the parameter passed to it.,,[]
Which of these methods are called depends on the type of the parameter passed to the Math.abs() method.,,[]
The Math.ceil() function rounds a floating point value up to the nearest integer value.,,[]
After executing this Java code the ceil variable will contain the value 8.0 .,,[]
The Math.floor() function rounds a floating point value down to the nearest integer value.,,[]
After executing this Java code the floor variable will contain the value 7.0 .,,[]
"The Math.floorDiv() method divides one integer (int or long) by another, and rounds the result down to the nearest integer value.",,[]
"The floorDiv() method rounds down to the nearest negative integer, instead of the rounding up that would occur with fraction truncation.",,[]
This shows the difference between the / division operator and Math.floorDiv() .,,[]
The Math.min() method returns the smallest of two values passed to it as parameter.,,[]
The Math.max() method returns the largest of two values passed to it as parameter.,,[]
The Math.round() method rounds a float or double to the nearest integer using normal math round rules (either up or down).,,[]
"After executing these two Java statements the roundedDown variable will contain the value 23.0 , and the roundedUp variable will contain the value 24.0.",,[]
The Math.random() method returns a random floating point number between 0 and 1.,,[]
"100, multiply the value returned by Math.random() with the maximum number (e.g.",,[]

The Java Math class also contains a set of functions intended for exponential and logarithmic calculations.,,[]
The Math.exp() function returns e (Euler's number) raised to the power of the value provided as parameter.,,[]
The Math.log10 method works like the Math.log() method except is uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e (Euler's Number).,"['difference: (math.log10, uses 10 as base instead of e, math.log())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (math.log10, uses 10 as base instead of e, math.log())""]"
"In other words, the Math.pow() example calculate the values of 22 and 28 which are 4 and 256.",,[]
The Math.sqrt() method calculates the square root of the parameter given to it.,,[]
"If you are looking for a trigonometric function and you cannot find it here, check the JavaDoc for the Java Math class.",,[]
"The Math class just might have the function you are looking for, even if I have not described it here.",,[]
The Math.PI constant is a double with a value that is very close to the value of PI - the mathematical definition of PI.,,[]
You will often need the Math.PI field when making trigonometric calculations.,"['implementation: (math, used for trigonometric calculations, pi)']",[]
The Math.sin() method calculates the sine value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.cos() method calculates the cosine value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.tan() method calculates the tangens value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.asin() method calculates the arc sine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.acos() method calculates the arc cosine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.atan() method calculates the arc tangens value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.sinh() method calculates the hyperbolic sine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.cosh() method calculates the hyperbolic cosine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.tanh() method calculates the hyperbolic tangens value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
Java methods are similar to what is called functions or procedures in other programming languages (e.g.,,[]
The example above defines a method called writeText inside a class named MyClass.,"['containment: (myclass, contains, writetext)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (myclass, contains, writetext)""]"
You can use any primitive data type or built-in Java class as data type for parameters.,,[]
"When the above Java code is executed, the writeText() method will get executed, and the parameters will contain the values ""Hello"" and ""World"".",,[]
"But, instead of returning to where the method was called from, the execution is resumed inside the first catch() { } clause surrounding the method, targeted at that exception.",,[]
"Notice how the method callSum() creates a variable called theSum, and assigns it the value returned by the add(1, 3) method call.",,[]
Before Java 9 and the Java Platform Module System you would have had to package all of the Java Platform APIs with your Java application because there was no official way of reliably checking what classes your Java application used.,,[]
"Since the Java Platform APIs have grown quite large over the years, your application would get a large amount of Java classes included in its distribution, many of which your application would probably not be using.","['containment: (java platform apis, include, java classes)']",[]
The unused classes makes your application distributable bigger than it needs to be.,,[]
from a missing JAR file) would not be detected until the application actually tried to use the missing class.,,[]
This would happen sometime at runtime - depending on when the application tried to use the missing class.,,[]
Having missing modules reported at application startup time is a big advantage compared to at runtime when trying to use the missing module / JAR / class.,,[]
"However, you should not use underscores (_) in module names (or package names, class names, method names, variable names etc.)",,[]
"Before Java 9 all Java classes for an application or API were nested directly inside a root class directory (which was added to the classpath), or directly inside a JAR file.",,[]
The module root directory is used both for the source files and compiled classes of a Java module.,,[]
Each Java module needs a Java module descriptor named module-info.java which has to be located in the corresponding module root directory.,,[]
Notice also how the module descriptor is suffixed .java and yet it uses a hyphen in the file name (module-info.java).,,[]
"Hyphens are not normally allowed in Java class names, but in module descriptor file names they are required!",,[]
This example module descriptor declares that it requires the standard Java module named javafx.graphics.,,[]
By split package is meant that the total content (classes) of the package is split between multiple modules.,,[]
"Inside that directory you will find a directory with the name of the module, and inside that directory you will find the compiled classes plus a compiled version of the module-info.java module descriptor named module-info.class.",,[]
"In order to run the main class of a Java module you use the java command, like this:",,[]
The --module argument tells what module + main class to run.,,[]
Notice how the module name and main class name are separated by a slash (/) character.,,[]
You can still set the JAR main class when generating the module JAR file.,,[]
Here is an example of setting the main class of a Java module JAR file:,,[]
You can now run the main class of this JAR file with a shortcut.,,[]
Here is how you run the main class from a Java module JAR file:,,[]
"If the Java module JAR file has a main class set (see a few sections earlier in this tutorial for how to do that), you can run the Java module main class with a little shorter command line.",,[]
Here is an example of running a Java module from a JAR file with a main class set:,,[]
The --module argument specifies which module plus main class to run.,,[]
"From Java 9 and forward, all Java classes must be located in a module for the Java VM to use them.",,[]
"But what do you do with older Java libraries where you just have the compiled classes, or a JAR file?",,[]
In Java 9 you can still use the -classpath argument to the Java VM when running an application.,,[]
"On the classpath you can include all your older Java classes, just like you have done before Java 9.","['containment: (classes, include, java)']",[]
All classes found on the classpath will be included in what Java calls the unnamed module.,"['containment: (all classes, included in, unnamed module)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (all classes, included in, unnamed module)""]"
"However, the classes in the unnamed module are only readable by other classes in the unnamed module - or from automatic modules (see next section).",,[]
No named module can read the classes of the unnamed module.,,[]
All classes in the unnamed module requires all modules found on the module path.,,[]
"That way, all classes in the unnamed module can read all classes exported by all the Java modules found on the module path.",,[]
"While you can include the third party library on the classpath and thus include it in the unnamed module, your own named modules cannot use it, because named modules cannot read classes from the unnamed module.",,[]
"An automatic module is made from a JAR file with Java classes that are not modularized, meaning the JAR file has no module descriptor.",,[]
When you place an ordinary JAR file on the module path (not the classpath) the Java VM will convert it to an automatic module at runtime.,,[]
"If your application contains multiple automatic modules, each automatic module can read the classes of all other automatic modules.",[],[]
This is different from explicitly named modules (real Java modules) which cannot read classes in the unnamed module.,,[]
"An automatic module exports all its packages, so all named modules on the module path can use the classes of an automatic module.","['containment: (module, exports, packages)', 'containment: (module, use, classes)']",[]
"If a JAR file contains versioning in its file name, e.g.",,[]
"The service interface is typically located in a service interface Java module which only contains the service interface, plus any classes and interfaces related to the service interface.","['containment: (service interface, is located in, service interface java module)', 'containment: (service interface java module, contains, service interface)', 'containment: (service interface java module, contains, classes)', 'containment: (service interface java module, contains, interfaces)']",[]
The com folder at the root level of the JAR file contains the compiled Java classes for pre Java 9 versions.,,[]
Earlier versions of Java do not understand multi Java version JAR files so they use the classes found here.,,[]
The META-INF directory contains the MANIFEST.MF file and a directory named versions.,,[]
The MANIFEST.MF file needs a special entry that marks the JAR file as a multi version JAR file.,,[]
The versions directory which can contain the compiled classes for different versions of Java for your module.,,[]
"Upgrading utility libraries first to automatic modules, and later to full modules, starting at the bottom of the dependency hierarchy should assure that your libraries can still read each other during upgrade, plus be readable by the main applications on the classpath in the unnamed module or as an automatic or named module.",,[]
In Java nested classes are classes that are defined inside another class.,,[]
"The purpose of a nested class is to clearly group the nested class with its surrounding class, signaling that these two classes are to be used together.",,[]
Or perhaps that the nested class is only to be used from inside its enclosing (owning) class.,"['containment: (nested class, to be used from inside, enclosing class)', 'containment: (nested class, to be used from inside, owning class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (nested class, to be used from inside, enclosing class)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (nested class, to be used from inside, owning class)""]"
"Java developers often refer to nested classes as inner classes, but inner classes (non-static nested classes) are only one out of several different types of nested classes in Java.","['similarity: (nested classes, refer to as, inner classes)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (nested classes, refer to as, inner classes)""]"
In Java nested classes are considered members of their enclosing class.,"['containment: (nested class, are considered members of, enclosing class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (nested class, are considered members of, enclosing class)""]"
"Thus, a nested class can be declared public, package (no access modifier), protected and private (see access modifiers for more info).","['containment: (public, access modifier, package)', 'containment: (public, access modifier, protected)', 'containment: (public, access modifier, private)', 'containment: (package, access modifier, protected)', 'containment: (package, access modifier, private)', 'containment: (protected, access modifier, private)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (public, access modifier, protected)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (public, access modifier, private)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (protected, access modifier, private)""]"
Therefore nested classes in Java can also be inherited by subclasses as explained in my tutorial about Java inheritance.,,[]
You can create several different types of nested classes in Java.,,[]
All these types of nested classes will be covered in the following sections.,,[]
"In order to create an instance of the Nested class you must reference it by prefixing it with the Outer class name, like this:","['creation: (nested, create an instance, outer)']",[]
In Java a static nested class is essentially a normal class that has just been nested inside another class.,"['containment: (static nested class, nested inside, class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (static nested class, nested inside, class)""]"
"Being static, a static nested class can only access instance variables of the enclosing class via a reference to an instance of the enclosing class.","['dependency: (static nested class, access via, instance variables)', 'dependency: (static nested class, access via, enclosing class)']",[]
Inner classes are associated with an instance of the enclosing class.,,[]
"Thus, you must first create an instance of the enclosing class to create an instance of an inner class.",,[]
Here is how you create an instance of the Inner class:,,[]
Notice how you put new after the reference to the outer class in order to create an instance of the inner class.,,[]
"Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to the fields of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.","['containment: (non-static nested classes, have access to, enclosing class)', 'containment: (inner classes, have access to, fields)', 'containment: (inner classes, have access to, enclosing class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (non-static nested classes, have access to, enclosing class)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (inner classes, have access to, enclosing class)""]"
Notice how the printText() method of the Inner class references the private text field of the Outer class.,"['dependency: (printtext(), references, inner)', 'containment: (inner, of the, outer)', 'dependency: (printtext(), references, text)', 'containment: (text, of the, outer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (printtext(), references, inner)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (inner, of the, outer)""]"
"If a Java inner class declares fields or methods with the same names as field or methods in its enclosing class, the inner fields or methods are said to shadow over the outer fields or methods.","['similarity: (inner class, shadow over, fields)']",[]
In the above example both the Outer and Inner class contains a field named text.,"['containment: (outer, contains, inner)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (outer, contains, inner)""]"
When the Inner class refers to text it refers to its own field.,,[]
"Java makes it possible though, for the Inner class to refer to the text field of the Outer class.","['containment: (outer, refers to the field of, inner)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (outer, refers to the field of, inner)""]"
To do so it has to prefix the text field reference with Outer.this.,,[]
Now the Inner.printText() method will print both the Inner.text and Outer.text fields.,,[]
Local classes in Java are like inner classes (non-static nested classes) that are defined inside a method or scope block ({ ... }) inside a method.,"['similarity: (local classes, are like, inner classes)', 'containment: (local classes, are defined inside, method)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (local classes, are like, inner classes)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (local classes, are defined inside, method)""]"
Local classes can only be accessed from inside the method or scope block in which they are defined.,"['containment: (classes, can only be accessed from inside, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (classes, can only be accessed from inside, methods)""]"
Local classes can access members (fields and methods) of its enclosing class just like regular inner classes.,"['containment: (local classes, access, members)', 'containment: (local classes, access, fields)', 'containment: (local classes, access, methods)', 'similarity: (local classes, just like, inner classes)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (local classes, access, members)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (local classes, access, fields)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (local classes, access, methods)"", ""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (local classes, just like, inner classes)""]"
"Local classes can also access local variables inside the same method or scope block, provided these variables are declared final.",,[]
From Java 8 local classes can also access local variables and parameters of the method the local class is declared in.,"['containment: (local class, declared in, method)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (local class, declared in, method)""]"
In that case the local class only has access to the static parts of the enclosing class.,"['containment: (class, access to, static)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, access to, static)""]"
"Local classes cannot contain all kinds of static declarations (constants are allowed - variables declared static final), because local classes are non-static in nature - even if declared inside a static method.",,[]
The same shadowing rules apply for local classes as for inner classes.,"['similarity: (local class, shadowing rules apply as, inner class)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (local class, shadowing rules apply as, inner class)""]"
Anonymous classes in Java are nested classes without a class name.,,[]
"They are typically declared as either subclasses of an existing class, or as implementations of some interface.","['alternative: (class, declared as either subclasses of, interface)']",[]
Here is an example that declares an anonymous subclass of a superclass called SuperClass:,,[]
Running this Java code would result in Anonymous class doIt() being printed to System.out.,"['containment: (system.out, being printed to, doit())', 'containment: (system.out, being printed to, anonymous class)', 'implementation: (anonymous class, running results in, doit())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (anonymous class, running results in, doit())""]"
The anonymous class subclasses (extends) SuperClass and overrides the doIt() method.,"['modification: (superclass, extends, doit())']",[]
A Java anonymous class can also implement an interface instead of extending a class.,,[]
"As you can see, an anonymous class implementing an interface is pretty similar to an anonymous class extending another class.",,[]
"You can declare fields and methods inside an anonymous class, but you cannot declare a constructor.","['containment: (class, declare fields and methods, method)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, declare fields and methods, method)""]"
"You can declare a static initializer for the anonymous class instead, though.",,[]
The same shadowing rules apply to anonymous classes as to inner classes.,"['similarity: (classes, shadowing rules apply, inner classes)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (classes, shadowing rules apply, inner classes)""]"
The benefits of Java nested classes are that you can group classes together that belong together.,,[]
"You could do so already by putting them in the same package, but putting one class inside another makes an even stronger grouping.","['containment: (class, inside, package)']",[]
A nested class is typically only used by or with its enclosing class.,,[]
"Sometimes a nested class is only visible to the enclosing class, is only used internally, and is thus never visible outside the enclosing class.","['containment: (nested class, visible to, enclosing class)', 'containment: (nested class, used internally by, enclosing class)', 'containment: (nested class, not visible outside, enclosing class)']",[]
"Other times the nested class is visible outside its enclosing class, but can only be used in conjunction with the enclosing class.","['containment: (enclosing class, visible outside, nested class)', 'containment: (nested class, conjunction with, enclosing class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (enclosing class, visible outside, nested class)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (nested class, conjunction with, enclosing class)""]"
"Inside the Cache class you might declare a CacheEntry class which can contain information about a specific cache entry (cached value, time inserted, number of times accessed etc.).","['containment: (cache, declare, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, declare, cacheentry)""]"
"Users of the Cache class may never see the CacheEntry class, if they have no need to obtain information about the CacheEntry itself, but only the cached value.","['containment: (cache, contains, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, contains, cacheentry)""]"
"However, the Cache class may choose to make the CacheEntry class visible to the outside world, so they can access more than just the cached value (for instance information about when the value was last refreshed etc.","['containment: (cache, make visible to, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, make visible to, cacheentry)""]"
The first Cache class hides its CacheEntry nested class while the second Cache class exposes it.,"['difference: (cache, hides-or-exposes, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (cache, hides-or-exposes, cacheentry)""]"
You instantiate an object of a certain class using the new keyword.,,[]
"This example declares a variable of the MyClass class (custom data type), and then creates a new MyClass instance and assigns a reference to this instance to myClassInstance variable.",,[]
"Inside the parantheses () after the for keyword, are three statements separated by semicolon (;).",,[]
"Here is a simple example of a class that has two methods, where one method calls the other:","['dependency: (class, has methods including, method)', 'dependency: (method, calls, method)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (class, has methods including, method)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (method, calls, method)""]"

The print() method is thus a reusable block of code that can be called from anywhere.,,[]
"When the print() method is finished executing, the program jumps back to after the line that called the print() method.",,[]
"Java packages are a mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the same ""group"" (package).",,[]
"When a Java project grows bigger, for instance an app or API, it is useful to split the code into multiple Java classes, and the classes into multiple Java packages.",,[]
"When you divide classes into multiple Java packages, it becomes easier to figure out where a certain class you are looking for is.","['containment: (class, divide into, package)']",[]
All Java source and class files of classes belonging to the same package are located in the same directory.,,[]
"Its a tree of packages, subpackages and classes inside these classes.","['containment: (package, contains, class)']",[]
"I have expanded two of the sublevel Java packages, so you can see the classes inside.",,[]
"The classes are illustrated using a little blue circle with a C inside, in the screenshot above.",,[]
"Similarly, the fully qualified name of a Java class includes its package name.",,[]
"For instance, the full qualified name of the ""Page"" class, is:",,[]
"In order to put add Java classes to packages, you must do two things:",,[]
Put the class files into the directory matching the package you want to add it to.,"['containment: (class files, into, package)']",[]
"When you have put your Java source file into the correct directory (matching the package the class should belong to), you have to declare inside that class file, that it belongs to that Java package.","['containment: (class, belongs to, package)']",[]
"Not like Java classes, where the first letter is usually a capital letter.",,[]
"If the classes A and B are located in the same Java package, there is no problem with the code above.","['containment: (package, located in the same, a)', 'containment: (package, located in the same, b)']",[]
"If you need to use a lot of classes from a certain Java package, importing them one at a time results in a lot of import statements.",,[]
It is possible to import all classes of a package using the * character instead of a class name.,,[]
It is possible to use a class from another package without importing it with an import statement.,"['alternative: (import, without_import_statement, package)']",[]
You can write the fully qualified class name instead of just the name of the class itself.,,[]
"The fully qualified class name consists of the full package path down to the subclass containing the class, and also including the class name itself.","['containment: (class name, consists of, package path)', 'containment: (class name, consists of, subclass)', 'containment: (class name, consists of, class name itself)', 'containment: (package path, down to, subclass)', 'containment: (package path, down to, class name)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class name, consists of, subclass)""]"
The fully qualified class name is also what you would write in an import statement.,,[]
"You could use this fully qualified class name to reference the TimeUtil class inside another class, like this:",,[]
"You might be wondering how you decide on what Java packages to create, and how to divide your classes into these packages.","['containment: (package, divide into, classes)']",[]
"The first method is to divide classes after what ""layer"" of the application they belong to.","['containment: (methods, belong to, classes)']",[]
All classes involved in communication with the database would then be located in the database package.,,[]
The second method is to divide your classes based on what part of the application functionality they belong to.,,[]

"When you compile all the source code in the source, the compiler produces one .class file for each .java file.",,[]
It is the .class files that the Java Virtual Machine can execute.,,[]
Therefore it is normal to separate the .java files from the .class files.,,[]
This is normally done by instructing the compiler to write the .class files into a separate directory.,,[]
"This directory is often called classes, but again, it is not a requirement, and it depends on what build tool or IDE etc.",,[]
The *.java means the compiler should compile all files in the given directory.,,[]

"The Java compiler then generates the corresponding fields, getter methods and a hashCode() and equals() method.","['implementation: (hashcode(), generates, equals())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (hashcode(), generates, equals())""]"
You use a Java Record just like you use other Java classes - by creating instances of the record type using the Java new keyword.,,[]
"Notice how the Java compiler has generated a brand() method, a licensePlate() method and a toString() method for us.","['implementation: (brand(), generated, licenseplate())', 'implementation: (brand(), generated, tostring())', 'implementation: (licenseplate(), generated, tostring())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (brand(), generated, licenseplate())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (brand(), generated, tostring())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (licenseplate(), generated, tostring())""]"
"A Record type definition is final, meaning you cannot create subclasses (subrecords) of a Java Record type.",,[]
You can add instance methods to a Java Record definition - just like you can with a regular Java class.,"['similarity: (record, add instance methods just like, class)', 'modification: (record, add instance methods to, instance methods)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (record, add instance methods just like, class)""]"
Here is an example of the Vehicle Java Record definition from earlier sections with an instance method named brandAsLowerCase() added:,,[]
Notice how the brandAsLowerCase() method calls the auto-generated brand() method internally.,"['dependency: (brandaslowercase(), calls internally, brand())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (brandaslowercase(), calls internally, brand())""]"
"That means, that even classes from different projects compiled separately, but which are used in the same application may share constant String objects.",,[]
"As you can see, a new StringBuilder is created, passing along the first String to its constructor, and the second String to its append() method, before finally calling the toString() method.","['dependency: (stringbuilder, calling sequence with, append())', 'dependency: (stringbuilder, calling sequence with, tostring())', 'dependency: (append(), calling sequence with, tostring())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stringbuilder, calling sequence with, append())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stringbuilder, calling sequence with, tostring())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (append(), calling sequence with, tostring())""]"
This code actually creates two objects: A StringBuilder instance and a new String instance returned from the toString() method.,"['creation: (stringbuilder, creates, string)', 'conversion: (tostring, returns, string)']",[]
"The bigger the result String grows, the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder, and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method.","['dependency: (stringbuilder, copy the characters from, tostring())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stringbuilder, copy the characters from, tostring())""]"
You can obtain the length of a String using the length() method.,,[]
You do so using the substring() method of the String class.,"['implementation: (substring(), method of, string)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (substring(), method of, string)""]"
The last character in the string has has the index String.length() - 1.,,[]
You can search for substrings in Strings using the indexOf() method.,"['implementation: (indexof(), search for substrings, strings)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (indexof(), search for substrings, strings)""]"
The indexOf() method returns the index of where the first character in the first matching substring is found.,,[]
"If the substring is not found within the string, the indexOf() method returns -1;",,[]
There is a version of the indexOf() method that takes an index from which the search is to start.,,[]
The Java String class also has a lastIndexOf() method which finds the last occurrence of a substring.,"['containment: (string, has method, lastindexof())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, has method, lastindexof())""]"
"The Java String matches() method takes a regular expression as parameter, and returns true if the regular expression matches the string, and false if not.",,[]
The equals() method tests if two Strings are exactly equal to each other.,,[]
The String class also has a method called equalsIgnoreCase() which compares two strings but ignores the case of the characters.,"['containment: (string, has method, equalsignorecase())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, has method, equalsignorecase())""]"
The startsWith() and endsWith() methods check if the String starts with a certain substring.,"['implementation: (startswith, method implementation, endswith)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (startswith, method implementation, endswith)""]"
"The compareTo() method compares the String to another String and returns an int telling whether this String is smaller, equal to or larger than the other String.",,[]
"If the String is earlier in sorting order than the other String, compareTo() returns a negative number.",,[]
"If the String is equal in sorting order to the other String, compareTo() returns 0.",,[]
"If the String is after the other String in sorting order, the compareTo() metod returns a positive number.",,[]
You should be aware that the compareTo() method may not work correctly for Strings in different languages than English.,,[]
The Java String class contains a method called trim() which can trim a string object.,"['containment: (java string, contains a method, trim())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (java string, contains a method, trim())""]"
The trim() method can be very useful to trim text typed into input fields by a user.,,[]
The trim() method is an easy way to remove such extra white space characters.,,[]
The Java String class contains a method named replace() which can replace characters in a String.,"['containment: (string, contains, replace())', 'modification: (replace(), replace characters in, string)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, contains, replace())""]"
The replace() method does not actually replace characters in the existing String.,,[]
"The replace() method will replace all character matching the character passed as first parameter to the method, with the second character passed as parameter to the replace() method.",,[]
The Java String replaceFirst() method returns a new String with the first match of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter.,,[]
The Java String replaceAll() method returns a new String with all matches of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter.,,[]
The Java String class contains a split() method which can be used to split a String into an array of String objects.,"['containment: (string, contains, split())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, contains, split())""]"
The parameter passed to the split() method is actually a Java regular expression.,,[]
The String split() method exists in a version that takes a limit as a second parameter.,,[]
Here is a Java String split() example using the limit parameter:,,[]
The Java String class contains a set of overloaded static methods named valueOf() which can be used to convert a number to a String.,"['containment: (string, contains, valueof())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, contains, valueof())""]"
"Since all Java classes extends (inherits from) the Object class, all objects have a toString() method.","['containment: (object, have, tostring())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (object, have, tostring())""]"
"Note: For the toString() method to return a sane String representation of the given object, the class of the object must have overridden the toString() method.",,[]
"If not, the default toString() method (inherited from the Object class) will get called.","['dependency: (tostring(), default method call, object)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (tostring(), default method call, object)""]"
The default toString() method does not provide that much useful information.,,[]
It is possible to get a character at a certain index in a String using the charAt() method.,"['implementation: (charat(), get character at certain index, string)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (charat(), get character at certain index, string)""]"
You can also get the byte representation of the String method using the getBytes() method.,,[]
The first getBytes() call return a byte representation of the String using the default character set encoding on the machine.,,[]
The second getBytes() call return a UTF-8 byte representation of the String.,,[]
You can convert Strings to uppercase and lowercase using the methods toUpperCase() and toLowerCase().,"['alternative: (touppercase(), conversion method, tolowercase())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (touppercase(), conversion method, tolowercase())""]"
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method named formatted() which can be used to return a formatted version of the String formatted() is called on.,"['implementation: (formatted(), method, java string)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (formatted(), method, java string)""]"
"The formatted() method is only a preview feature that was added together with Java Text Blocks in Java 13, so we do not yet know if it will stay in.",,[]
Here is an example of using the Java String formatted() method:,,[]
The parameter values passed to formatted() will be inserted into the returned String at the %s location of the input String.,,[]
"From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method named stripIndent() which can be used to strip out indentation, similarly to how indentation is stripped out of Java Text Blocks.","['containment: (string, class got a new method named, stripindent())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, class got a new method named, stripindent())""]"
"The stripIndent() method is a preview feature, so we don't know if it will stay in Java yet.",,[]
Here is an example of using the new Java String stripIndent() method:,,[]
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method called translateEscapes() which can translate escape codes that exist inside a String in the same way the Java compiler translates them.,"['conversion: (string, translate escape codes, translateescapes())']",[]
"For now, the translateEscapes() is a preview feature, so it is not yet sure that it will stay in Java.",,[]
Here is an example of using the Java String translateEscapes() method:,,[]
When calling the translateEscapes() method the \n part of the text will now be interpreted as a line break escape code.,,[]
The String class has several other useful methods than the ones described in this tutorial.,,[]
"The result of this is, that execution just ""falls through"" to the operation of the next case statement ( and the next etc.)",,[]
All Java code must reside inside a file with the extension .java .,,[]
"Below is an example .java file that contains all of the above elements, so you can see the basic syntax of a .java file:",,[]
The .java file should be located in a directory structure that matches the package name.,,[]
"Please note, that the code example does not actually use the Java HashMap class anywhere.",,[]
Of course you should not import classes you do not use in a real project.,,[]
"In Java a type is either a class, an abstract class an interface, an enum or an annotation.","['similarity: (class, is similar to, interface)']",[]
A type (class / interface / enum) can have more than one field.,"['containment: (class, have more than one field, interface)', 'containment: (class, have more than one field, enum)', 'containment: (interface, have more than one field, enum)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (class, have more than one field, enum)""]"
The fifth line (or block of lines) is a class initializer block.,,[]
Inside this block you can put initialization code that is to be executed a instance of the class is created.,,[]
"Then they are executed already when the class is loaded, and only once because the class is only loaded in the Java Virtual Machine once.",,[]
"Constructors are similar to class initializers, except they can take parameters.",,[]
"A class can have more than one constructor, although this example just shows one.","['containment: (class, have, constructor)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, have, constructor)""]"
When you create an instance of a class (an object) the object can have methods you can execute.,"['containment: (class, have, methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, have, methods)""]"
"A static method belongs to the class, not objects of the class.","['containment: (method, belongs to, class)']",[]
That means that you can call a static method without having an object of the class the static method belongs to.,,[]
"In the example above, if case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to true then the ternary operator expression as a whole returns the String value JOHN.",,[]
"If case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to false then the ternary operator expression as a whole returns the String value john.",,[]
"That means, that the String variable name will end up having the value JOHN or john depending on whether the expression case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to true or false.",,[]
"As you can see, both of these code examples avoid calling object.getValue() if the object reference is null, but the first code example is a bit shorter and more elegant.",,[]
You can achieve the same functionality as the Java Math max() function using a Java ternary operator.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.max() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
The Java ternary operator can also be used to achieve the same effect as the Java Math min() function.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.min() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
The Java ternary operator can also be used to achieve the same effect as the Java Math abs() function.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.abs() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
"If the input String is not equal to the empty String, the second ternary operator returns the value of Integer.parseInt(input) .",,[]
"This can be any kind of information ranging from texts, codes (e.g.",,[]
"In the code example below, the main() method contains the declaration of a single integer variable named number.",,[]
"Non-static fields are also called instance variables, because they belong to instances (objects) of a class.",,[]
A static field is a variable that belongs to a class.,,[]
The second line assigns the floating point value 199.99 to the floating point variable named myFloat.,,[]
"In this example, only the first System.out.println() statement is executed inside the while loop.",,[]
The second System.out.println() statement is not executed until after the while loop is finished.,,[]
"This is typically done via a command line interface (CLI), like e.g.",,[]
On the command line you tell the JVM what Java class (bytecode) to execute.,"['implementation: (jvm, execute, java class)']","[""('interface', 'implementation', 'class'): (jvm, execute, java class)""]"
Only the full Java SDK contains the Java compiler which turns your .java source files into byte code .class files.,"['containment: (java sdk, contains, java compiler)']",[]
"Additionally, some Java servers may need some of the tools in the JDK to e.g.",,[]
"The Java Code Conventions are a set of conventions for how to format your Java code, and how to name classes, variables, files etc.",,[]
JavaFX was inspired by Flex (Flash) and Silverlight for .NET (Microsoft).,,[]
In this tutorial I will show you how to make your first Java app with IntelliJ IDEA community edition (free) version 2019.3.3.,,[]
"How you do that depends on what operating system you are running (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.)",,[]
"A Java package is just a directory inside which you can put one or more Java files (class, interface, annotation, enum etc.","['containment: (package, directory inside which you can put, class)', 'containment: (package, directory inside which you can put, interface)']",[]
Now you must create a new class inside your newly created package.,"['creation: (class, create, package)']",[]
"In the dialog that opens, type in a name for your new Java class.",,[]

"When you have typed in a name for your new Java class, click the ""OK"" button.",,[]
"Once you have created the new class, it will be empty.",,[]
The part inside the /* ... */ are comments and are not part of the executed Java code.,,[]
Before you can run your Java app you need to insert a main() method into the class.,"['containment: (class, contains, main())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contains, main())""]"
Now your are ready to run your newly created Java class.,,[]
"You do so by right clicking the class source code in the editor, and choose ""Run..."", like this:",,[]
"When you click the ""Run..."" option, IntelliJ IDEA will first compile your Java class, and then run it.",,[]

The most common way of using the Java Logging API is to create a Logger in each class that needs to log.,"['creation: (logger, create, logging api)']",[]
"This instance is typically made static and final, meaning all instances of that class use the same Logger instance.",,[]
"As you can see from this example, it is common practice to use the class name including package name as name for the Logger.",,[]
The name of the Logger to create is passed as string parameter to the Logger.getLogger() method.,,[]
"For instance, ordinary debug trace logging calls to entering() and exiting() would be called at the beginning and end of a method call.","['dependency: (entering(), method call sequence, exiting())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (entering(), method call sequence, exiting())""]"
The initialization of the configuration is taken care of by the java.util.logging.LogManager class.,,[]
You can use a Java class to configure the Java Logging API.,,[]
You do so by specifying the name of the class in the JVM parameter java.util.logging.config.class.,,[]
It is the constructor of that class that should load the configuration and apply it to the Logger's in the hierarchy.,"['dependency: (constructor, load the configuration and apply it, logger)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (constructor, load the configuration and apply it, logger)""]"
"If no configuration class is specified, you can instead specify a configuration file (but no configuration class can be specified then!",,[]
"The Java Logging API has a default logging configuration file located at ""lib/logging.properties"", inside the JRE directory.",,[]
You do so by setting the JVM property java.util.logging.config.file to point to this file.,,[]
You should double check the JavaDoc over time to see if any of this changes (e.g.,,[]
"If the isLoggable() method returns false, the LogRecord is not logged.","['interruption: (isloggable(), not logged, logrecord)']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'class'): (isloggable(), not logged, logrecord)""]"
The Handler's in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord's before writing it to an external system.,"['dependency: (java.util.logging.formatter, formats, logrecord)']",[]
"The various Handler's in the Java Logging API use either of these two Formatter's by default, but you can also set your own custom Formatter subclass on a Handler.","['dependency: (handler, use formatter, formatter)', 'preference: (handler, set custom, formatter)', 'containment: (handler, in, logging)']","[""('class', 'preference', 'class'): (handler, set custom, formatter)""]"

The subclass must override the abstract format() method in the Formatter class.,"['implementation: (formatter, must override, format())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (formatter, must override, format())""]"
The String returned by the format() is what is forwarded to the external system by the Handler.,,[]
The Formatter class also contains the convenience method formatMessage() which can be used to format the message using the ResourceBundle of the LogRecord.,"['containment: (formatter, contains, formatmessage())', 'dependency: (formatmessage(), uses, resourcebundle)', 'dependency: (formatmessage(), uses, logrecord)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (formatter, contains, formatmessage())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (formatmessage(), uses, resourcebundle)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (formatmessage(), uses, logrecord)""]"

"If no %g code has been specified and the file count of the FileHandler is greater than 1, then the generation number (file sequence number) will be appended to the end of the file name, after a dot (.)",,[]
You must set one using the method setOutputStream() before using the handler.,,[]
You can also call the push() method to force the LogRecord's in the buffer to be flushed to the target Handler.,"['implementation: (push(), force flushing, logrecord)', 'dependency: (push(), require, handler)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (push(), force flushing, logrecord)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (push(), require, handler)""]"
This class contains a constant for each of the above log levels.,,[]
When you create a Logger you pass a name to the Logger.getLogger() method.,,[]
(Note: These levels are different from the log levels of the messages logged.).,,[]
If you call getParent() on that Logger you will get the Logger with the name com.,"['dependency: (logger, calling, getparent())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (logger, calling, getparent())""]"

The accept() method returns a Socket which behaves like an ordinary Java Socket.,"['creation: (accept(), returns, socket)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (accept(), returns, socket)""]"
Only one incoming connection is opened for each call to the accept() method.,,[]

The java.net package contains two interesting classes: The URL class and the URLConnection class.,"['containment: (java.net, contains classes, url)', 'containment: (java.net, contains classes, urlconnection)']",[]
These classes can be used to create client connections to web servers (HTTP servers).,,[]
"If you want to send an HTTP POST request instead, call the URLConnection.setDoOutput(true) method, like this:",,[]
The URL class can also be used to access files in the local file system.,,[]
"Thus the URL class can be a handy way to open a file, if you need your code to not know whether the file came from the network or local file system.",,[]
Here is an example of how to open a file in the local file system using the URL class:,,[]

The first parameter to the open() method is a Path instance pointing to the file the AsynchronousFileChannel is to be associated with.,"['dependency: (open(), associated with, asynchronousfilechannel)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (open(), associated with, asynchronousfilechannel)""]"
In this example we used the StandardOpenOption.READ which means that the file will be opened for reading.,,[]
Each way to read data call one of the read() methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel.,"['implementation: (asynchronousfilechannel, calls, read())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (asynchronousfilechannel, calls, read())""]"
The first way to read data from an AsynchronousFileChannel is to call the read() method that returns a Future.,"['dependency: (asynchronousfilechannel, call read method, read)', 'dependency: (asynchronousfilechannel, returns, future)']",[]
This version of the read() method takes ByteBuffer as first parameter.,"['dependency: (read(), takes as a parameter, bytebuffer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (read(), takes as a parameter, bytebuffer)""]"
"The read() method return immediately, even if the read operation has not finished.",,[]

Here is a longer example showing how to use this version of the read() method:,,[]
"This example creates an AsynchronousFileChannel and then creates a ByteBuffer which is passed to the read() method as parameter, along with a position of 0.","['creation: (asynchronousfilechannel, creates, bytebuffer)', 'dependency: (asynchronousfilechannel, passed to, read())', 'dependency: (bytebuffer, passed to, read())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (asynchronousfilechannel, passed to, read())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (bytebuffer, passed to, read())""]"

Once the read operation has completed the data read into the ByteBuffer and then into a String and printed to System.out .,"['conversion: (bytebuffer, read into, system.out)']",[]
The second method of reading data from an AsynchronousFileChannel is to call the read() method version that takes a CompletionHandler as a parameter.,"['dependency: (asynchronousfilechannel, reads data using, read())', 'dependency: (read(), takes as parameter, completionhandler)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (asynchronousfilechannel, reads data using, read())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (read(), takes as parameter, completionhandler)""]"

"If the read operation fails, the failed() method of the CompletionHandler will get called instead.","['dependency: (failed(), called, completionhandler)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (failed(), called, completionhandler)""]"
Each way to write data call one of the write() methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel.,"['dependency: (asynchronousfilechannel, calls, write())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (asynchronousfilechannel, calls, write())""]"

"Once you need to read the data, you need to switch the buffer from writing mode into reading mode using the flip() method call.",,[]
You can do this in two ways: By calling clear() or by calling compact().,"['alternative: (clear(), or, compact())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (clear(), or, compact())""]"
The compact() method only clears the data which you have already read.,,[]
Here is an example that writes data into a Buffer via the put() method:,"['implementation: (put(), writes data into, buffer)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (put(), writes data into, buffer)""]"

"There are many other versions of the get() method, allowing you to read data from the Buffer in many different ways.","['implementation: (get(), read data, buffer)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (get(), read data, buffer)""]"
"The Buffer.rewind() sets the position back to 0, so you can reread all the data in the buffer.",,[]

You can do so either by calling clear() or by calling compact().,"['alternative: (clear(), or by calling, compact())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (clear(), or by calling, compact())""]"
If you call clear() the position is set back to 0 and the limit to capacity.,,[]
"If there is any unread data in the Buffer when you call clear() that data will be ""forgotten"", meaning you no longer have any markers telling what data has been read, and what has not been read.",,[]

compact() copies all unread data to the beginning of the Buffer.,"['modification: (compact(), copies unread data, buffer)']",[]
"The limit property is still set to capacity, just like clear() does.",,[]
You can mark a given position in a Buffer by calling the Buffer.mark() method.,,[]
You can then later reset the position back to the marked position by calling the Buffer.reset() method.,,[]
It is possible to compare two buffers using equals() and compareTo().,"['alternative: (equals(), compare, compareto())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (equals(), compare, compareto())""]"
The FileChannel class has a transferTo() and a transferFrom() method which does this for you.,"['implementation: (filechannel, has_method, transferto())', 'implementation: (filechannel, has_method, transferfrom())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (filechannel, has_method, transferto())"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (filechannel, has_method, transferfrom())""]"

The Java NIO FileChannel class is NIO's an alternative to reading files with the standard Java IO API.,,[]
To read data from a FileChannel you call one of the read() methods.,"['implementation: (filechannel, read data using, read())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (filechannel, read data using, read())""]"
The int returned by the read() method tells how many bytes were written into the Buffer.,,[]
"Writing data to a FileChannel is done using the FileChannel.write() method, which takes a Buffer as parameter.","['implementation: (filechannel.write(), writing data, filechannel)', 'dependency: (filechannel.write(), takes a parameter, buffer)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (filechannel.write(), writing data, filechannel)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (filechannel.write(), takes a parameter, buffer)""]"
There is no guarantee of how many bytes the write() method writes to the FileChannel.,"['dependency: (write(), bytes_write_to, filechannel)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (write(), bytes_write_to, filechannel)""]"
Therefore we repeat the write() call until the Buffer has no further bytes to write.,,[]
You can obtain the current position of the FileChannel object by calling the position() method.,"['dependency: (filechannel, obtain position by calling, position())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (filechannel, obtain position by calling, position())""]"

The FileChannel.force() method flushes all unwritten data from the channel to the disk.,,[]
"An operating system may cache data in memory for performance reasons, so you are not guaranteed that data written to the channel is actually written to disk, until you call the force() method.",,[]
"The force() method takes a boolean as parameter, telling whether the file meta data (permission etc.)",,[]
The Java NIO Files class (java.nio.file.Files) provides several methods for manipulating files in the file system.,,[]
"The Files class contains many methods, so check the JavaDoc too, if you need a method that is not described here.",,[]
The Files class just might have a method for it still.,,[]
"The java.nio.file.Files class works with java.nio.file.Path instances, so you need to understand the Path class before you can work with the Files class.",,[]
The Files.exists() method checks if a given Path exists in the file system.,"['containment: (files.exists(), checks if a given, path)']",[]
"Since Path instances may or may not point to paths that exist in the file system, you can use the Files.exists() method to determine if they do (in case you need to check that).",,[]
"Second, the example calls the Files.exists() method with the Path instance as the first parameter.","['dependency: (files.exists(), calls with, path)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (files.exists(), calls with, path)""]"
This parameter is an array of options that influence how the Files.exists() determines if the path exists or not.,,[]
In this example above the array contains the LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS which means that the Files.exists() method should not follow symbolic links in the file system to determine if the path exists.,"['containment: (linkoption.nofollow_links, contains, files.exists())']",[]
The Files.createDirectory() method creates a new directory from a Path instance.,"['creation: (files.createdirectory(), creates a new directory from, path)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (files.createdirectory(), creates a new directory from, path)""]"

"Then the example calls Files.copy(), passing the two Path instances as parameters.","['dependency: (files.copy(), passing, path)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (files.copy(), passing, path)""]"
It is possible to force the Files.copy() to overwrite an existing file.,,[]
Here an example showing how to overwrite an existing file using Files.copy():,,[]
This parameter instructs the copy() method to overwrite an existing file if the destination file already exists.,,[]
The Java NIO Files class also contains a function for moving files from one path to another.,,[]

"If a message cannot fit into the 4KB buffer, a larger buffer of e.g.",,[]
For 1.000.000 concurrent connections that results in 1.000.000 x 4KB = 4GB which is possible in most servers today (2015).,,[]
Another workaround is to time out messages which have not been received within e.g.,,[]
The fact that TLV encodings makes memory management easier is one of the reasons why HTTP 1.1 is such a terrible protocol.,,[]
That is one of the problems they are trying to fix in HTTP 2.0 where data is transported in LTV encoded frames.,"['implementation: (http 2.0, transported in, ltv encoded frames)']",[]
This is also why we have designed our own network protocol for our VStack.co project that uses a TLV encoding.,,[]
Imagine if you have 1.000.000 connections which are mostly idle and all 1.000.000 connections were registered with the Selector.,,[]

"In many cases though, you can replace the use of the File class with use of the Path interface.","['alternative: (file, replace with, path)']",[]
In order to use a java.nio.file.Path instance you must create a Path instance.,,[]
You create a Path instance using a static method in the Paths class (java.nio.file.Paths) named Paths.get().,"['creation: (paths, creates using paths.get(), paths.get())', 'containment: (paths, includes, java.nio.file.paths)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (paths, creates using paths.get(), paths.get())""]"

It is the call to the Paths.get() method that creates the Path instance.,,[]
"The Paths.get() method is a factory method for Path instances, in other words.",,[]
Creating an absolute path is done by calling the Paths.get() factory method with the absolute file as parameter.,,[]
The Java NIO Path class can also be used to work with relative paths.,,[]
The second example creates a Path instance which points to the path (file) d:\data\projects\a-project\myfile.txt .,,[]
If you use the .. code in the middle of a path string it will correspond to changing one directory up at that point in the path string.,,[]
The .. code after the a-project directory changes directory up the the parent directory projects and then the path references down into the another-project directory from there.,,[]
and .. codes also work in combination with the two-string Paths.get() method.,,[]
Here are two Java Paths.get() examples showing simple examples of that:,,[]
There are more ways that the Java NIO Path class can be used to work with relative paths.,,[]
The Java Path method relativize() can create a new Path which represents the second Path relative to the first Path.,,[]

The normalize() method of the Path interface can normalize a path.,"['implementation: (path, normalize, path)']",[]
"and .. codes in the middle of the path string, and resolves what path the path string refers to.",,[]
This Path example first creates a path string with a .. code in the middle.,,[]

"It is possible to load and reload classes at runtime in Java, though it is not as straightforward as one might have hoped.",,[]
This text will explain when and how you can load and reload classes in Java.,,[]
"You can argue whether Java's dynamic class loading features are really part of Java Reflection, or a part of the core Java platform.",,[]
All classes in a Java application are loaded using some subclass of java.lang.ClassLoader.,,[]
Loading classes dynamically must therefore also be done using a java.lang.ClassLoader subclass.,,[]
"When a class is loaded, all classes it references are loaded too.",,[]
"This class loading pattern happens recursively, until all classes needed are loaded.",,[]
Unreferenced classes are not loaded until the time they are referenced.,,[]
"If a ClassLoader is asked to load a class, it will ask its parent class loader to load it.",,[]
"If the parent class loader can't find the class, the child class loader then tries to load it itself.",,[]
The steps a given class loader uses when loading classes are:,,[]
When you implement a class loader that is capable of reloading classes you will need to deviate a bit from this sequence.,,[]
The classes to reload should not be requested loaded by the parent class loader.,,[]
All you need to do is to obtain a ClassLoader and call its loadClass() method.,"['dependency: (classloader, obtain, loadclass())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (classloader, obtain, loadclass())""]"
Java's builtin Class loaders always checks if a class is already loaded before loading it.,,[]
Reloading the class is therefore not possible using Java's builtin class loaders.,"['interruption: (class, reloading is not possible using, class loaders)']",[]
To reload a class you will have to implement your own ClassLoader subclass.,,[]
Even with a custom subclass of ClassLoader you have a challenge.,,[]
"This method is final, and thus cannot be overridden in your ClassLoader subclass.",,[]
The resolve() method will not allow any given ClassLoader instance to link the same class twice.,,[]
"Therefore, everytime you want to reload a class you must use a new instance of your ClassLoader subclass.",,[]
"This is not impossible, but necessary to know when designing for class reloading.",,[]
As stated earlier you cannot reload a class using a ClassLoader that has already loaded that class once.,,[]
Therefore you will have to reload the class using a different ClassLoader instance.,,[]
"Every class loaded in a Java application is identified by its fully qualified name (package name + class name), and the ClassLoader instance that loaded it.",,[]
"That means, that a class MyObject loaded by class loader A, is not the same class as the MyObject class loaded with class loader B.","['difference: (myobject, not the same class as, class loader a)', 'difference: (myobject, not the same class as, class loader b)']","[""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (myobject, not the same class as, class loader a)"", ""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (myobject, not the same class as, class loader b)""]"
"Notice how the MyObject class is referenced in the code, as the type of the object variable.",,[]
This causes the MyObject class to be loaded by the same class loader that loaded the class this code is residing in.,"['dependency: (myobject, to be loaded by, class loader)', 'containment: (myobject, is a, class)', 'dependency: (class loader, loaded, class)']",[]

"Since the two MyObject classes were loaded with different class loaders, the are regarded as different classes, even if they have the same fully qualified class name.",,[]
Trying to cast an object of the one class to a reference of the other will result in a ClassCastException.,,[]
"Either of these two methods will work if the type of the variable, the interface or superclass, is not reloaded when the implementing class or subclass is reloaded.","['alternative: (method, work if not reloaded, subclass)']",[]
To make this work you will of course need to implement your class loader to let the interface or superclass be loaded by its parent.,"['implementation: (interface, be loaded by its parent, superclass)']","[""('interface', 'implementation', 'class'): (interface, be loaded by its parent, superclass)""]"

Notice how it delegates class loading to its parent except for the one class it is intended to be able to reload.,,[]
"If the loading of this class is delegated to the parent class loader, it cannot be reloaded later.",,[]
"Remember, a class can only be loaded once by the same ClassLoader instance.",,[]
It is not a production ready template for your own class loaders.,,[]
"Your own class loaders should probably not be limited to a single class, but a collection of classes that you know you will need to reload.",,[]
"In addition, you should probably not hardcode the class paths either.",,[]
Here is the reflection.MyObject class that is loaded using the class loader.,,[]
Notice how it both extends a superclass and implements an interface.,,[]
The name of this class is why I refer to these dynamic interface implementations as dynamic proxies.,"['containment: (class, refer to, interface)']",[]
As mentioned earlier you must pass an InvocationHandler implementation to the Proxy.newProxyInstance() method.,,[]
The proxy parameter passed to the invoke() method is the dynamic proxy object implementing the interface.,,[]
The Method object passed into the invoke() method represents the method called on the interface the dynamic proxy implements.,,[]
"But now you can check via the mock if the DAO uses the connection properly, for instance if the connection.close() is called (or NOT called), if you expected that.",,[]
Thus the factory interface and your class could look something like this:,"['creation: (factory interface, could look like, class)']",[]

When you write a class or interface you can specify that it should be paramerizable.,"['similarity: (class, paramerizable feature, interface)']",[]
"Rather than create a list of Object you can parameterize java.util.List to create a list of say String, like this:",,[]

When using Java reflection the starting point is often a Class object representing some Java class you want to inspect via reflection.,,[]
"For instance, to obtain the Class object for a class named MyObject you could write:",,[]
Now you have a reference to the Class object for the MyObject class.,,[]
"Once you have a reference to the Class object representing some class, you can see what fields that class contains.",,[]
Here is an example of accessing fields of a Java class:,,[]
Using Java Reflection it is possible find out what constructors a given Java class contains and what parameters they take etc.,,[]
You can also see what methods a given class has from its Class object.,,[]
Here is an example of accessing the methods a given class via Java reflection:,,[]
You can also use Java reflection to find out what getter and setter methods a class has.,"['containment: (class, contains, getter)', 'containment: (class, contains, setter)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contains, getter)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, contains, setter)""]"
You can even access private fields and methods via Java reflection - even from outside the class that owns the private field or method.,,[]

"Java reflection has a special Proxy class that can implement a Java Interface dynamically at runtime, rather than at compile time.","['implementation: (proxy, dynamically implement, interface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (proxy, dynamically implement, interface)""]"
In Java it is possible to dynamically load and also reload classes using a Java ClassLoader.,,[]
"The ClassLoader class is actually not part of the Java Reflection API, but since Java Reflection is often used to achieve ""dynamic"" behaviour (behavioral changes at runtime), and dynamic class loading and reloading kind of fits into this theme, I have decided to include that tutorial in my Java Reflection tutorial.",,[]
Dynamic class loading and reloading is explained in my Java Reflection - Dynamic Class Loading and Reloading tutorial.,,[]
The Java regex API is located in the java.util.regex package which has been part of standard Java (JSE) since Java 1.4.,,[]
"Although Java regex has been part of standard Java since Java 1.4, this Java regex tutorial covers the Java regex API released with Java 8.","['containment: (java, part of standard java since, java 1.4)', 'containment: (java regex api, released with, java 8)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java, part of standard java since, java 1.4)""]"
But first I will introduce the core classes of the Java regex API in the following section.,,[]
The Matcher class is used to match a given regular expression (Pattern instance) against a text multiple times.,"['dependency: (matcher, match against, pattern)']",[]
Both the Pattern and Matcher classes are covered in detail in their own texts.,"['containment: (pattern, covered in detail, matcher)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (pattern, covered in detail, matcher)""]"
The third line uses the Pattern.matches() static method to check if the regular expression (pattern) matches the text.,,[]
"If the regular expression matches the text, then Pattern.matches() returns true.",,[]
If the regular expression does not match the text Pattern.matches() returns false.,,[]
"The example does not actually check if the found http:// string is part of a valid URL, with domain name and suffix (.com, .net etc.).",,[]
"Here is another Java regex example which uses the Matcher class to locate multiple occurrences of the substring ""is"" inside a text:",,[]
The special metacharacter meaning of an escaped metacharacter is ignored - only its actual literal value (e.g.,,[]
Java regular expressions support matching any of a specified set of characters using what is referred to as character classes.,,[]
"The character class (set of characters to match) is enclosed in the square brackets - the [ae] part of the regular expression, in other words.",,[]
"The character class will match one of the enclosed characters regardless of which, but no mor than one.",,[]
"For instance, the character class [a-z] will match all characters between a lowercase a and a lowercase z, both a and z included.",,[]
You can have more than one character range within a character class.,,[]
"For instance, the character class [a-zA-Z] will match all letters between a and z or between A and Z .",,[]
"For instance, the character class [0-9] will match the characters between 0 and 9, both included.",,[]
"If you want to match the square brackets inside a character class, here is how that looks:",,[]
The character class contains the two square brackets escaped (\\[ and \\]).,,[]
You can match digits of a number with the predefined character class with the code \d.,,[]
Matching non-digits can be done with the predefined character class [\D] (uppercase D).,,[]
You can match word characters with the predefined character class with the code \w .,,[]
You can match non-word characters with the predefined character class [\W] (uppercase W).,,[]
Here is a regular expression example using the non-word character class:,,[]
The Java String class has a few regular expression methods too.,"['containment: (string, has, regular expression methods)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, has, regular expression methods)""]"
The Java String split() method splits the string into N substrings and returns a String array with these substrings.,"['conversion: (string.split(), splits_into_substrings, string)', 'conversion: (string.split(), returns_as_array, string[])', 'conversion: (string, split_into_substrings, string[])']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (string, split_into_substrings, string[])""]"
The split() method takes a regular expression as parameter and splits the string at all positions in the string where the regular expression matches a part of the string.,,[]
The Java Matcher class (java.util.regex.Matcher) is used to search through a text for multiple occurrences of a regular expression.,,[]
I will cover the core methods of the Java Matcher class in this tutorial.,,[]
"For a full list, see the official JavaDoc for the Matcher class.",,[]
Here is a quick Java Matcher example so you can get an idea of how the Matcher class works:,"['similarity: (matcher, example, matcher class)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (matcher, example, matcher class)""]"
"The matches() returns true if the regular expression matches the text, and false if not.",,[]
You can do a whole lot more with the Matcher class.,,[]
The Pattern class is covered separately in my Java Regex Pattern tutorial.,,[]
Creating a Matcher is done via the matcher() method in the Pattern class.,"['creation: (matcher(), is created via, pattern class)']",[]
"The matches() method in the Matcher class matches the regular expression against the whole text passed to the Pattern.matcher() method, when the Matcher was created.","['implementation: (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text, matcher)', 'dependency: (matches(), requires a pattern, pattern.matcher())', 'creation: (matcher, created by passing text to the pattern, pattern.matcher())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text, matcher)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (matches(), requires a pattern, pattern.matcher())"", ""('class', 'creation', 'method'): (matcher, created by passing text to the pattern, pattern.matcher())""]"
"If the regular expression matches the whole text, then the matches() method returns true.",,[]
You cannot use the matches() method to search for multiple occurrences of a regular expression in a text.,,[]
"For that, you need to use the find(), start() and end() methods.","['implementation: (find(), use, start())', 'implementation: (find(), use, end())', 'dependency: (start(), and, end())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (find(), use, start())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (find(), use, end())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (start(), and, end())""]"
The Matcher lookingAt() method works like the matches() method with one major difference.,"['difference: (lookingat(), works like the matches() method with one major difference, matches())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), works like the matches() method with one major difference, matches())""]"
"The lookingAt() method only matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text, whereas matches() matches the regular expression against the whole text.","['difference: (lookingat(), matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text while, matches())', 'difference: (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text whereas, lookingat())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text while, matches())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text whereas, lookingat())""]"
"In other words, if the regular expression matches the beginning of a text but not the whole text, lookingAt() will return true, whereas matches() will return false.","['difference: (lookingat(), return true while matches return false, matches())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), return true while matches return false, matches())""]"
Matching the regular expression against the beginning of the text (lookingAt()) will return true.,,[]
"Matching the regular expression against the whole text (matches()) will return false, because the text has more characters than the regular expression.",,[]
"The Matcher find() method searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to the Pattern.matcher(text) method, when the Matcher was created.","['dependency: (matcher.find(), was created, pattern.matcher())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (matcher.find(), was created, pattern.matcher())""]"
"If multiple matches can be found in the text, the find() method will find the first, and then for each subsequent call to find() it will move to the next match.",,[]
The methods start() and end() will give the indexes into the text where the found match starts and ends.,"['implementation: (start(), gives, indexes into text where match starts)', 'implementation: (end(), gives, indexes into text where match ends)']",[]
Actually end() returns the index of the character just after the end of the matching section.,,[]
"Thus, you can use the return values of start() and end() inside a String.substring() call.",,[]
The Matcher reset() method resets the matching state internally in the Matcher.,"['modification: (matcher.reset(), resets the matching state, matcher)']",[]
"In case you have started matching occurrences in a string via the find() method, the Matcher will internally keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text.","['dependency: (matcher, keep a state, find())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (matcher, keep a state, find())""]"
By calling reset() the matching will start from the beginning of the text again.,,[]
"Of course you could do this with the start() and end() methods, but it is easier to do so with the group functions.","['alternative: (start(), easier to do so with, group functions)']",[]
The Matcher replaceAll() and replaceFirst() methods can be used to replace parts of the string the Matcher is searching through.,"['replacement: (replaceall(), used to replace parts of the string, replacefirst())']",[]
"The Matcher appendReplacement() and appendTail() methods are used to replace string tokens in an input text, and append the resulting string to a StringBuffer.","['modification: (appendreplacement(), replace string tokens, appendtail())', 'containment: (appendreplacement(), append resulting string, stringbuffer)', 'containment: (appendtail(), append resulting string, stringbuffer)']","[""('method', 'modification', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), replace string tokens, appendtail())""]"
"When you have found a match using the find() method, you can call the appendReplacement().","['dependency: (find(), calls, appendreplacement())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (find(), calls, appendreplacement())""]"
"The appendReplacement() method keeps track of what has been copied into the StringBuffer, so you can continue searching for matches using find() until no more matches are found in the input text.","['dependency: (appendreplacement(), keeps track of usage, find())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), keeps track of usage, find())""]"
By calling appendTail() you can append these last characters to the StringBuffer too.,,[]
"Notice how appendReplacement() is called inside the while(matcher.find()) loop, and appendTail() is called just after the loop.","['interruption: (appendreplacement(), is_called_inside, appendtail())']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), is_called_inside, appendtail())""]"
"The Java Pattern class (java.util.regex.Pattern), is the main access point of the Java regular expression API.",,[]
"Whenever you need to work with regular expressions in Java, you start with Java's Pattern class.",,[]
A regular expression is also sometimes referred to as a pattern (hence the name of the Java Pattern class).,,[]
You can use the Pattern.matches() method to quickly check if a text (String) matches a given regular expression.,,[]
Or you can compile a Pattern instance using Pattern.compile() which can be used multiple times to match the regular expression against multiple texts.,,[]
The easiest way to check if a regular expression pattern matches a text is to use the static Pattern.matches() method.,,[]
"This Pattern.matches() example searches the string referenced by the text variable for an occurrence of the word ""is"", allowing zero or more characters to be present before and after the word (the two .",,[]
"The Pattern.matches() method is fine if you just need to check a pattern against a text a single time, and the default settings of the Pattern class are appropriate.","['implementation: (pattern.matches(), check a pattern against a text, pattern)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (pattern.matches(), check a pattern against a text, pattern)""]"
"If you need to match for multiple occurrences, and even access the various matches, or just need non-default settings, you need to compile a Pattern instance using the Pattern.compile() method.",,[]
"If you need to match a text against a regular expression pattern more than one time, you need to create a Pattern instance using the Pattern.compile() method.",,[]
You can also use the Pattern.compile() method to compile a Pattern using special flags.,,[]
The Java Pattern class contains a list of flags (int constants) that you can use to make the Pattern matching behave in certain ways.,,[]
"For more information of the flags you can use with the Java Pattern class, see the JavaDoc for Pattern .",,[]
The Matcher class has a matches() method that tests whether the pattern matches the text.,"['implementation: (matcher, tests, matches())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (matcher, tests, matches())""]"
"Too keep this text short, the Matcher covered in more detail in the text about the Java Matcher class.","['containment: (matcher, covered in more detail in, java matcher)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (matcher, covered in more detail in, java matcher)""]"
"The split() method in the Pattern class can split a text into an array of String's, using the regular expression (the pattern) as delimiter.","[""containment: (split(), into an array of string's, string)"", 'implementation: (split(), using the regular expression as delimiter, pattern)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (split(), using the regular expression as delimiter, pattern)""]"
This Pattern.split() example splits the text in the text variable into 5 separate strings.,,[]
Each of these strings are included in the String array returned by the split() method.,,[]
The pattern() method of the Pattern class simply returns the pattern string (regular expression) that the Pattern instance was compiled from.,"['containment: (pattern(), returns the pattern string, pattern)']",[]
Character classes are constructst that enable you to specify a match against multiple characters instead of just one.,,[]
"In other words, a character class matches a single character in the input text against multiple allowed characters in the character class.",,[]
Character classes are nested inside a pair of square brackets [].,,[]
"The character class [Jj] will match either a J or a j, and the rest of the expression will match the characters ohn in that exact sequence.",,[]
The Java regular expression syntax has a few predefined character classes you can use.,,[]
"For instance, the \d character class matches any digit, the \s character class matches any white space character, and the \w character matches any word character.",,[]
"The predefined character classes do not have to be enclosed in square brackets, but you can if you want to combine them.",,[]
The predefined character classes are listed in a table later in this text.,,[]
"The Java GZIPInputStream class (java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream) can be used to decompress files that are compressed with the GZIP compression algorithm, for instance via the GZIPOutputStream class.","['dependency: (java.util.zip.gzipinputstream, is_decompressed_by, java.util.zip.gzipoutputstream)']",[]
In the example above I passed it a FileInputStream connected to a file named myfile.zip.,,[]
When you are finished reading data from the GZIPInputStream you should close it using its close() method.,"['dependency: (gzipinputstream, should be closed using, close())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (gzipinputstream, should be closed using, close())""]"
The Java GZIPOutputStream class (java.util.zip.GZIPOutStream) can be used to GZIP compress data and write it to an OutputStream.,"['conversion: (java.util.zip.gzipoutputstream, compress data and write, java.io.outputstream)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (java.util.zip.gzipoutputstream, compress data and write, java.io.outputstream)""]"
This Java ZIP tutorial explains how the core classes of the Java ZIP API works.,,[]
The Java ZipFile class is used to work with ZIP files containing multiple files.,,[]
The Java GZIPInputStream and GZIPOutputStream classes are used to ZIP compress a single file.,"['similarity: (gzipinputstream, used to zip compress a single file, gzipoutputstream)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (gzipinputstream, used to zip compress a single file, gzipoutputstream)""]"
The above classes will be covered in detail their own tutorials (see the side menu for links).,,[]
The Java ZipFile class (java.util.zip.ZipFile) can be used to read files from a ZIP file.,,[]
This tutorial will show you how to use the ZipFile class.,,[]
In order to use the Java ZipFile class you must first create a ZipFile instance.,,[]
"As you can see, the ZipFile class takes a single parameter in its constructor.",,[]
Each file in the ZIP file is represented by a ZipEntry (java.util.zip.ZipEntry).,"['containment: (zipentry, is represented by, java.util.zip.zipentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (zipentry, is represented by, java.util.zip.zipentry)""]"
To extract a file from the ZIP file you can call the method getEntry() method on the ZipFile class.,"['dependency: (getentry(), method call, zipfile)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (getentry(), method call, zipfile)""]"
This example gets a ZipEntry representing the file file1.txt which is contained in the ZIP file.,,[]
The InputStream obtained from the getInputStream() of the ZipFile class can be read like any other Java InputStream.,"['containment: (zipfile, obtained from, getinputstream)', 'similarity: (getinputstream, can be read like, inputstream)']",[]
You can list all entries contained in a ZipFile using the entries() method.,"['containment: (zipfile, contains, entries())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (zipfile, contains, entries())""]"
You can iterate the Enumeration returned by the entries() method like this:,,[]
The Zip Slip attack consists of adding entries to a ZipFile that contains relative file paths with one or more /.. sections in the path.,,[]
An entry in the ZipFile has the relative path ../../../../etc/hosts .,,[]
The final path of that entry becomes: /apps/myapp/data/unzipped-file/../../../../etc/hosts which is equivalent of /etc/hosts .,,[]
"Unzipping this file could potentially overwrite hour hosts file (on a Linux OS), enabling the attacker to point e.g.",,[]
"The Java examples in this tutorial were created with Java 8, and Acme4J Client v. 2.1 and Acme4J Utils v. 0.3.",,[]
Here is a Java class capable of creating a private key for use with Acme4J:,,[]
Here is a class that can create a Let's Encrypt account:,,[]
It is the execute() method that starts the account creation process.,,[]
The fully qualified name for the Order class is org.shredzone.acme4j.Order .,,[]
Calling create() results in a request being sent to Let's Encrypt.,,[]
Once you have called the order.create() method a request is sent to Let's Encrypt.,,[]
"The above example specifically looks for an HTTP authorization object, which is then triggered by calling challenge.trigger().",,[]
"Before the challenge is triggered, you must read the value from challenge.getAuthorization() and upload it in a file to your web server.",,[]
"... where ${domain} is the domain for which you are requesting the domain for (returned by challenge.getDomain() ), and ${token} is the value returned by challenge.getToken().","['containment: (challenge.getdomain(), domain for, challenge.gettoken())']","[""('method', 'containment', 'method'): (challenge.getdomain(), domain for, challenge.gettoken())""]"
"If your code cannot access your web server to upload the challenge file before calling challenge.trigger(), you can run the code in your debugger, set a breakpoint before calling challenge.trigger(), pause the code at that breakpoint, read the token (file name) and authorization (file content) out of the challenge object, upload that to your web server, and then continue the code in the debugger.",,[]
That is what happens in the last part of the processAuth() method.,,[]
"First, the code above waits until the Order object has status Status.VALID.",,[]
The value of that Ant property will be inserted at the place of the ${...} code.,,[]
This example first defines a property named dir.build which has its value set to build.,,[]
"Second, this example defines a property named dir.build.classes which has its value set to ${dir.build}/classes .",,[]
"When Ant defines this property it will resolve the value of the referenced property dir.build, and insert its value where the property is reference.",,[]
"Thus, the second Ant property defined will have its final value set to build/classes because build is the value of the dir.build property referenced.",,[]
"The echo task as defined here will print out the message ""This is version 1.2.3"" to the console.",,[]
"Just to recap, a ""Java build tool"" is a tool which can compile Java code, run the unit tests for it, package the compiled classes into a JAR file and many, many other things.",,[]
This Ant tutorial is based on Ant version 1.9.6 which is the newest version of Ant at the time of writing (august 2015).,,[]
"Inside the project directory you have just created, create an empty file named build.xml.",,[]
"By default Ant looks for a build script named build.xml in your project root directory, so you might as well call your Ant build script build.xml.",,[]
"You could use another name, but using build.xml makes your Ant commands shorter, and it makes it easier for other developers to find the Ant build script.",,[]
Open the build.xml file and insert the following text (XML) into it:,,[]
You can test this build file by opening a command prompt and change directory into the directory that contains the build.xml file and execute this command:,,[]
"This test was performed using Java 5, Butterfly Container 1.9.11-beta, and Guice 1.0.",,[]
"The test performs 10.000.000 instantiations of a TestProduct class using a no-arg constructor, for each DI mechanism.",,[]
Java is a statically typed language meaning that types (primtives and classes) cannot change at runtime.,,[]
"It is not like you can all of a sudden let your Java class members, method parameters and variables be untyped.",,[]
"This is done at the beginning, by the method call BO.setDao(dao).",,[]
"But, notice how no DI is used inside the BO.checkPersonIsValid() or the DAO.readPerson() methods.","['dependency: (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), dependency, dao.readperson())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), dependency, dao.readperson())""]"
I most likely never have to change implementation of the Person class.,,[]
In Java this will result in a class cast exception at runtime (or some similar type error exception).,,[]
"Each factory definition states how a given instance is to be created and configured, when calling the container.instance() method.",,[]
"The input parameters .hashcode() and .equals() methods determine if an input parameter has an instance associated with it already, or a new one needs to be created and associated with the input parameter for succeeding calls.","['dependency: (.hashcode(), determine association with, .equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (.hashcode(), determine association with, .equals())""]"
As you can see the constructor call was chained with a call to the setValue() method.,,[]
"Notice how the length() method is called on the ""value"" parameter.",,[]
"If the setValue() method in the example above returns void, the factory will return the SomeObject instance the method was called on.",,[]
The factory defined by this script will return a SomeObject instance that has had the two methods setValue() and setValue2() invoked on it.,"['dependency: (setvalue(), invocation requirement, setvalue2())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (setvalue(), invocation requirement, setvalue2())""]"
"Here is a list of classes and primitives that parameters can be converted to, automatically:",,[]

You can cast to any type or class available on the classpath.,"['conversion: (type, cast to, classpath)']",[]
"To call a static method instead of a constructor when creating an instance of some class, simply write as you would in Java:",,[]
Note: The container uses java.util.ArrayList and java.util.HashSet as the List and Set implementations.,"['implementation: (java.util.arraylist, uses as list implementation, java.util.hashset)', 'implementation: (java.util.hashset, uses as set implementation, java.util.arraylist)']",[]
From version 2.5.9 Butterfly Container Script provides a shortcut to configuring Map instances.,,[]
First an instance of SomeObject is created and then the setValue() method is called on it.,,[]
Below is an example that register the newly created instance with a static method in the MyClass class.,"[""dependency: (register, 'uses a static method in', myclass)""]","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (register, 'uses a static method in', myclass)""]"
You can inject instances of classes created locally in a factory definition.,,[]
"Notice how the setNewValue() method is called on the instance obtained from the bean1 factory, before it is injected into OtherObject's constructor.",,[]
"Thus, the setFurtherValue() method of the someObject singleton is called for each instance of bean2 created, even if the method call is redundant.",,[]
"Notice how the bean2 definition obtains an instance from the bean1 factory, and calls the setValue() method on it before returning it.",,[]
"Input parameters can be given to the container.instance() method, like this:",,[]
"The container cannot determine the type of input parameters until runtime, when the container.instance() method is called.",,[]
Therefore it is only possible to call methods that exists in java.lang.Object on input parameters.,,[]
"Your application will ask the container for an object, and the container will make sure that all dependencies (config parameters, collaborating objects, texts etc.)",,[]
"Rather than having to design integration mechanisms yourself, and decide on configuration formats etc., you can have the dependency injection container do all that for you.",,[]
"The ""connectionTimeout"" factory is defined as a singleton returning whatever value the CONNECTION_TIMEOUT constant is set to in the Constants class.",,[]
The simplest way to add a function is to create a static method in a Java class that performs the logic for the function.,"['implementation: (method, performs logic for, class)']",[]

As you can see the List.add() method is called twice to add the string and myDataSource factory product to the list.,,[]
The fact One of the advantages you get when designing your own language is the freedom to e.g make methods that return void chainable.,,[]
"The [] around the values in the setSomeList() call signals that the values are to be put inside a List or array, depending on the setSomeList() parameter type.",,[]
It is possible to map classes to tables and columns using annotations.,,[]
You cannot have more than one mapping for the same class using annotation based mapping alone.,,[]
Each annotation is only allowed once in the code for a given class by the Java compiler.,,[]
There are two types of annotations available: A class annotation Annotations for getters and setters.,,[]
AClassMapping The class annotation (AClassMapping) is used ontop of your class name for your POJO classes.,,[]
"If you set the mappingMode to ""modify"" then Butterfly Persistence will first use automatic mapping to guess as much as it can, and then look at the annotations and modify the class mapping accordingly.",,[]
"The tableName element can be set to the name of the table the class is to be mapped to, if it cannot be guessed by the automatic mapping mechanism.","['containment: (class, mapped to, tablename)']",[]

The class annotation (AClassMapping) is used ontop of your class name for your POJO classes.,,[]
"Notice how the second class definition uses manual mapping, so the getter and setter must be fully mapped to columns in the database.",,[]
The ASetterMapping annotation is used to map setters of classes to columns in database tables or SQL queries.,,[]
In this example the Employee.class object is the object mapping key.,,[]
"However, if you want Butterfly Persistence to be able to auto-map the target class to the database, the object mapping key should be either a Class object, or an IObjectMappingKey instance.","['containment: (class, auto-map, iobjectmappingkey)']",[]
"The IObjectMappingKey instance can contain more information about the class to be mapped, than a Class object can.","['containment: (iobjectmappingkey, contain more information about, class)', 'difference: (iobjectmappingkey, can contain more information than, class)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (iobjectmappingkey, contain more information about, class)"", ""('class', 'difference', 'class'): (iobjectmappingkey, can contain more information than, class)""]"
"An IObjectMappingKey instance has a getObjectClass() method that returns the Class object of the class to map, so automatic mapping is possible in either case.","['dependency: (iobjectmappingkey, has a, getobjectclass())', 'dependency: (iobjectmappingkey, returns the class object of, class)', 'containment: (getobjectclass(), returns the class object of, class)']","[""('interface', 'dependency', 'method'): (iobjectmappingkey, has a, getobjectclass())""]"
When checking for tables with similar names to the class to map only the class name itself is used.,,[]
The ObjectMapper generates various textual combinations based on the class name and checks the database meta data to see if any of these match.,,[]
"The ObjectMapper mapper breaks the class name into words, based on the uppercase letters and numbers in the class name.",,[]
Based on these combinations the PersistentObject class name would be similar to the table names PersistentObject persistentObject persistentobject PERSISTENTOBJECT Persistent_Object persistent_object PERSISTENT_OBJECT PersistentObjects persistentObjects persistentobjects PERSISTENTOBJECTS PERSISTENTOBJECTs Persistent_Objects persistent_objects PERSISTENT_OBJECTS PERSISTENT_OBJECTs As you can see there is a reasonable chance that the table name will be guessed if it is similar to the class name.,,[]
"The Object Mapper uses reflection to iterate the methods of the class to be mapped, and filters out all other methods than getters and setters.","['implementation: (object mapper, uses reflection to iterate the methods of, setters)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (object mapper, uses reflection to iterate the methods of, setters)""]"
If your custom mapper implementation returns an object mapping from the getObjectMapping() method then automatic and annotation based mapping are not applied.,,[]
"If a table name is returned from the getTableName() method, then Butterfly Persistence will not try to guess a table name, nor look at the class annotation for table name.",,[]
If null is returned Butterfly Persistence will look at the class annotation to see if a table name is set there.,,[]
If the getObjectMapping() method returned null Butterfly Persistence will call the modify() method to allow your custom object mapper to modify the automatically generated mapping.,"['dependency: (getobjectmapping(), calling sequence, modify())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getobjectmapping(), calling sequence, modify())""]"

The IJdbcDao has a few read() methods that allows you to decide what to do with each record in the ResultSet resulting from some SQL query.,"['implementation: (ijdbcdao, has_methods, read())', 'dependency: (ijdbcdao, decide_with, resultset)']",[]

Version control systems typically also makes it easier for multiple people to collaborate - e.g.,,[]

The build task will compile all your Java classes and create a JAR file with them in.,,[]
Gradle outputs classes and JAR file to the directory named build inside your project root directory.,,[]

The Predicate interface (java.util.function.Predicate) contains a few methods that help you compose new Predicate instances from other Predicate instances.,,[]
The and() method is used to combine two other Predicate functions in the same way I showed in the beginning of this Java functional composition tutorial.,,[]
Here is an example of functional composition with the Predicate and() method:,,[]

"The Java Predicate interface, java.util.function.Predicate, represents a simple function that takes a single value as parameter, and returns true or false.","['containment: (predicate, is part of, java.util.function.predicate)', 'containment: (java.util.function.predicate, is within, java.util.function)']",[]
"The Predicate interface contains more methods than the test() method, but the rest of the methods are default or static methods which you don't have to implement.","['containment: (predicate, contains, test())']",[]
"You can implement the Predicate interface using a class, like this:",,[]
This lambda implementation of the Predicate interface effectively does the same as the implementation above that uses a class.,,[]
This Java Consumer implementation prints the value passed as parameter to it out to System.out.,,[]
"Especially the idea of ""no side effects"" makes it hard to e.g.",,[]
"In the functional programming paradigm, functions are first class objects in the language.",,[]
Notice how the return value of the sum() function only depends on the input parameters.,,[]
"Notice also that the sum() has no side effects, meaning it does not modify any state (variables) outside the function anywhere.",,[]
"Notice how the method add() uses a member variable to calculate its return value, and it also modifies the state of the value member variable, so it has a side effect.",,[]
Notice how the createFactory() method returns a lambda expression as result.,,[]
Notice also that the createFactory() method takes two instances as parameters which are both implementations of interfaces (IProducer and IConfigurator).,"['dependency: (createfactory(), takes as parameters, iproducer)', 'dependency: (createfactory(), takes as parameters, iconfigurator)', 'implementation: (iproducer, implementations of interfaces, iconfigurator)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (createfactory(), takes as parameters, iproducer)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (createfactory(), takes as parameters, iconfigurator)""]"
Therefore they can be implemented by Java lambda expressions - and therefore the createFactory() method is a higher order function.,,[]
"A function may have local variables containing temporary state internally, but the function cannot reference any member variables of the class or object the function belongs to.",,[]
"State outside of a function refers both to member variables in the class or object the function, and member variables inside parameters to the functions, or state in external systems like file systems or databases.",,[]
"This is still a functional interface, because only run() is not implemented (abstract).",,[]
The first example of a higher order function is the Collections.sort() method which takes a Comparator as parameter.,"['dependency: (collections.sort(), takes as parameter, comparator)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (collections.sort(), takes as parameter, comparator)""]"
The lambda parameter is what makes Collections.sort() a higher order function.,,[]
"Second, the example calls the reversed() method on the Comparator lambda.",,[]
"The reversed() method returns a new Comparator lambda, which reverse the result returned by the first Comparator implementation.","['implementation: (reversed(), returns a new comparator lambda, comparator)']",[]
"By ""reversing"" I mean that it simply returns -1 * comparator.compare(a,b)",,[]
"Because the reversed() method returns a lambda (function), the reversed() method is considered a higher order function.",,[]
"Third, the example sorts the List of Strings using the Collections.sort() method.",,[]

Here is an example of calling the Java Stream filter() method:,,[]
The Java Stream map() method converts (maps) an element to another object.,"['conversion: (stream, converts_to, map())']",[]
The Java Stream flatMap() methods maps a single element into multiple elements.,,[]
This example should give you an idea about how flatMap() can be used to map a single element into multiple elements.,,[]
This Java Stream flatMap() example first creates a List with 3 strings containing book titles.,,[]
"Then a Stream for the List is obtained, and flatMap() called.","['dependency: (stream, is obtained for, flatmap())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stream, is obtained for, flatmap())""]"

Note that this example finishes with a call to forEach() which is a terminal operation.,,[]

"A graph based stream processing API could instead support a ""sample"" operation where each node in the stream processing graph is asked for any value it may hold internally (e.g.",,[]

The full code for the command line argument parsers is listed at the end of this tutorial (it's just one class).,,[]
The interpretation of these command line arguments could be that the copy program should copy file.txt to a file named file2.txt and overwrite file2.txt if it already exists.,,[]
These command line arguments consists of one switch (-overwrite) and two targets (file.txt and file.2.txt).,,[]
"When the switch -overwrite is removed, the two arguments file.txt and file2.txt remain.",,[]
The command line argument parser consists of a single Java class named CliArgs.,,[]
The CliArgs class takes an array of String as argument to its constructor.,,[]
The CliArgs class contains the following methods you can use to obtain switch information and values:,,[]
The switchPresent() method can be used to ask if a given switch is present or not.,,[]
"If the command line arguments contains the -overwrite switch anywhere, the switchPresent() method will return true.",,[]
The switchValue() method can be use to obtain the value of a switch.,,[]
Here is a code example showing how to use switchValue() to read the value of the -port switch:,,[]
If you want the value of a switch parsed into a long or double you can use the switchLongValue() and switchDoubleValue() methods.,"['implementation: (switchlongvalue(), parsed into, switchdoublevalue())', 'implementation: (switchdoublevalue(), parsed into, switchlongvalue())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (switchlongvalue(), parsed into, switchdoublevalue())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (switchdoublevalue(), parsed into, switchlongvalue())""]"
The switchValues() method is used to obtain multiple values for a switch.,,[]
The switchValues() method will return all values after the switch and until the next switch is met (next argument starting with a - character).,,[]
The values of the -from switch will be file1.txt and file2.txt.,,[]
The values of the -to switch will be copy1.txt and copy2.txt.,,[]
Instead you can create a swith POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class to hold all the switches.,,[]

The targets() method returns all the arguments which are not switches or switch values.,,[]

"will the method targets() as executed in the code above, return the String",,[]

You may need to have at least N next bytes (e.g.,,[]

"You could use the String.replace() method, but for large amounts of data, and high number of replacements, this performs badly.",,[]

Quite often Java applications keep objects in data structures that contain java.util.ArrayList instances.,"['containment: (java.util.arraylist, keep objects in, java.util)']",[]
This tutorial will also look at the performance of the OpenArrayList class - a class that mimics the java.util.ArrayList but designed with performance in mind.,"['alternative: (openarraylist, mimics, java.util.arraylist)']",[]
Each element is obtained from the ArrayList instance using the get() method.,"['containment: (arraylist, is obtained from, get())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (arraylist, is obtained from, get())""]"
The third way to iterate an ArrayList is to use an java.util.Iterator obtained from the ArrayList.,"['containment: (java.util.iterator, obtained from, java.util.arraylist)']",[]
The benchmarks were executed using JDK 1.8.0_u60 on a Intel Core i7-4770 Haswell server which was doing nothing but the benchmarks.,,[]
"You can also see that iterating an ArrayList using a standard Java for loop with a counter, and obtaining each element by calling the ArrayList get() method is about 10% faster for an ArrayList with 10 elements, and around 12,5% faster when the ArrayList contains 100 elements.","['dependency: (arraylist, using, get())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (arraylist, using, get())""]"
The OpenArrayList class is a very simple imitation of the ArrayList which I have implemented to see if it could iterate a collection of elements faster than an ArrayList .,"['similarity: (openarraylist, imitation, arraylist)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (openarraylist, imitation, arraylist)""]"
"This should be a tiny bit faster than calling the ArrayList get() method, although the JVM could optimize the get() method call away.","['preference: (arraylist, faster_than, get())']",[]
Another advantage of making the elements array public is that you can write to it or copy from it using System.arraycopy() which is very fast.,,[]

"As you can see, the readMyData() method returns a MyData object.","['creation: (readmydata(), returns, mydata)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (readmydata(), returns, mydata)""]"
What is worth noting about this read pattern is that every time you call the readMyData() method a new MyData object is returned.,,[]
If the readMyData() method is called frequently that will lead to a lot of MyData objects being created.,,[]
Here is how the earlier readMyData() method would look using the read-into-existing pattern:,,[]
"It is now up to the caller of the readMyData() method to decide if an existing MyData instance should be reused, or if a new instance should be created.",,[]
Reusing an object also means that the chance the object is located in the CPU cache is much higher than when you create a new object for each call to the readMyData() method.,,[]
To change the previous example code to read data directly from the underlying source we need to change the implementation of the MyData class:,,[]
"To use the MyData class in its new variation, you will use code like this:",,[]
Just call setSource() when you need to read data out of a new byte array.,,[]
"Third, only if you actually call both getVal1() and getVal2() will the corresponding data be read out of the underlying byte array.","['dependency: (getval1(), calling sequence, getval2())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getval1(), calling sequence, getval2())""]"
"Assuming that each MyData object consists of 2 bytes from the underlying source, here is how the MyData class would look with a navigation method added:",,[]
The first change is the that the setSource() method now takes an extra parameter called offset.,,[]
The second change is that the getVal1() and getVal2() methods now use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array when reading values out.,"['dependency: (getval1(), use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array, getval2())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getval1(), use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array, getval2())""]"
"The next() method increments the internal offset variable by 2, so that the offset variable points to the next record in the array.",,[]
The fourth change is the addition of the hasNext() method which returns true if the source byte array has more records (bytes) in it.,,[]
"As you can see, using the MyData class in the navigator pattern implementation is pretty straightforward.",,[]
"Additionally, if your server works on many tasks at the same time (e.g incoming HTTP requests), the other CPUs in your server may already be busy working on their own tasks.",,[]

"The JMH Maven archetype will generate a new Java project with a single, example benchmark Java class, and a Maven pom.xml file.","['containment: (java, inclusion, pom.xml)']",[]
The Maven pom.xml file contains the correct dependencies to compile and build your JMH microbenchmark suite.,,[]
"It is time to write your first JMH benchmark class, or at least see how it is done.",,[]
The generated MyBenchmark class is a JMH class template which you can use to implement your JMH benchmarks.,"['implementation: (mybenchmark, is a jmh class template, jmh)']",[]
"You can either implement your benchmarks directly in the generated MyBenchmark class, or create a new class in the same Java package.","['containment: (mybenchmark, in, java package)']",[]
To make it easy for you to write your first JMH benchmark I will just use the generated class in this example.,,[]
You can put the code you want to measure inside the testMethod() method body.,,[]
"For now, just imagine that the testMethod() body actually contained a good benchmark implementation.",,[]
"When you build your JMH benchmarks, Maven will always generate a JAR file named benchmarks.jar in the target directory (Maven's standard output directory).",,[]
It contains your compiled benchmark classes as well as all JMH classes needed to run the benchmark.,,[]
"If your benchmarks has any external dependencies (JAR files from other projects needed to run your benchmarks), declare these dependencies inside the Maven pom.xml, and they will be included in the benchmarks.jar too.",,[]
"Since benchmarks.jar is fully self contained, you can copy that JAR file to another computer to run your JMH benchmarks on that computer.",,[]
This means that you want the output shown using the time unit minutes (e.g.,,[]

In this example I have added a nested static class named MyState.,,[]
Notice that the testMethod() benchmark method now takes an instance of MyState as parameter.,,[]
Notice also that the testMethod() body has now been changed to use the MyState object when performing its sum calculation.,,[]
Notice the two new methods in the MyState class named doSetup() and doTearDown().,"['containment: (mystate, contains_methods, dosetup())', 'containment: (mystate, contains_methods, doteardown())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (mystate, contains_methods, dosetup())"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (mystate, contains_methods, doteardown())""]"

Sometimes a lot of time is even spent just allocating and freeing memory (e.g.,,[]
"When you control object allocation, deallocation and reallocation you can make limits like e.g.",,[]
having a maximum of 10.000 messages in memory at a time.,,[]
"The batch size can thus vary from 1 to a maximum upper limit set by the system, e.g.",,[]
"To achieve lower latency, yet allowing for micro batching to happen, you can loop over the input channels (inbound network connections, directories etc.)",,[]
Therefore it can be beneficial to batch up data sent outside a process to minimize the overhead per data block (e.g.,,[]
"Instead of traversing the whole data structure to serve just one ""request"" (task, message etc.)",,[]
Notice how two different DAO's were called from inside the control's execute() method.,,[]
"To make this happen you need to obtain a database connection (or equivalent object) inside the Control.execute() method, and pass this connection (or other object) to each DAO.",,[]
"Well, you could if you call a setConnection() method on them afterwards.",,[]
The DaoManager is a class that you put in between the Control and the DAO's.,,[]
Once the DaoManager.executeAndClose() method finishes the database connection inside the DaoManager is closed.,,[]
"As you can see from the code example in the previous section, the scope of the connection when managed by the DaoManager.executeAndClose() is the boundaries of the executeAndClose() method.",,[]
This could be the case in a desktop application if each control is registered independently as listeners on e.g.,,[]
It is the DaoManager's executeAndClose() method that demarcates the life span of the underlying connection.,,[]

The ScopingDataSource will be moved to Butterfly Persistence from around version 5.2.0 or 5.4.0 which will be released in 2009.,,[]
The ScopingDataSource is an implementation of the standard Java interface javax.sql.DataSource.,,[]

"This ScopingConnection ignores all calls to the close() method, so the underlying connection can be reused.",,[]
"When you are ready to close the connection your control calls the ScopingDataSource.endConnectionScope(), and the currently open connection (if any) is closed.",,[]
"From here on the ScopingDataSource behaves just like a regular DataSource, returning a new Connection for every call to getConnection().",,[]

The first problem you run into when designing DAO classes is connection scoping.,,[]
A naive implementation of a DAO class using JDBC to target a relational database might look like below (at least I have designed DAO's like this in the past).,"['implementation: (dao, implementation target, jdbc)']",[]
Notice how the readPerson() method opens its own connection and closes it again once it is done.,,[]
You might also be able to hide connection closing from the domain logic by adding a close() method to the DAO.,,[]
But somewhere in the domain logic you would have to call that close() method.,,[]
The method call daoFactory.beginConnectionScope() marks the beginning of a connection scope.,,[]
The method call daoFactory.endConnectionScope() ends the current connection scope and closes the connection associated with the scope.,,[]
This way neither of the DAO's need to have close() methods.,,[]
The methods beginTransaction() and endTransaction() mark the beginning and end of the transaction.,"['dependency: (begintransaction(), marks the beginning, endtransaction())', 'dependency: (endtransaction(), marks the end, begintransaction())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (begintransaction(), marks the beginning, endtransaction())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (endtransaction(), marks the end, begintransaction())""]"
The beginTransaction() method will call connection.setAutoCommit(false) for the connection associated with the transaction scope.,"['dependency: (begintransaction(), call, connection.setautocommit(false))']",[]
The endTransaction() method will attempt to commit the transaction and call setAutoCommit(false) again.,"['dependency: (endtransaction(), call, setautocommit())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (endtransaction(), call, setautocommit())""]"
Notice the new method call in the catch-block of the transaction scope: daoFactory.abortTransaction(e).,"['dependency: (aborttransaction, call, transaction)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (aborttransaction, call, transaction)""]"
This method call rolls the transaction back if an exception is thrown from any of the dao methods or from endTransaction().,,[]
"The DAO layer usually consists of a smaller set of classes, than the number of domain logic classes that uses it.",,[]
"It is also a somewhat more controlled operation, since you can search for all DAO classes, and make sure they are changed to use the new persistence mechanism.",,[]
"To solve the problems mentioned earlier, you can move some of the code to a DaoManager class.",,[]
Notice that the getPersonDao() method isn't synchronized even though it returns a kind of singleton.,,[]
"Rather than implementing a close() method in the DaoManager class, a template method will be added called executeAndClose().","['alternative: (close(), implementing a, executeandclose())', 'containment: (executeandclose(), in, daomanager)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (close(), implementing a, executeandclose())""]"
This instance then has it's execute() method invoked with the DaoManager itself as parameter.,,[]
Now the scope of the connection is marked by the scope of the method call executeAndClose().,,[]
"Any exception handling related to the connection.close() call can be hidden away inside the executeAndClose() method, and reused throughout the application.","['containment: (executeandclose(), handles, connection.close())']","[""('method', 'containment', 'method'): (executeandclose(), handles, connection.close())""]"
You can add a transaction() method similar to the executeAndClose() method which takes care of transaction management.,"['similarity: (transaction(), similar to, executeandclose())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (transaction(), similar to, executeandclose())""]"
"For instance, if both commit() and rollback() throws exceptions, both of these exception are not properly preserved or handled.","['interruption: (commit(), throws exceptions, rollback())']","[""('method', 'interruption', 'method'): (commit(), throws exceptions, rollback())""]"
Using the transaction() method is analogous to using the executeAndClose() method:,"['similarity: (transaction(), analogous to, executeandclose())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (transaction(), analogous to, executeandclose())""]"
This could be done by wrapping the call to transaction() inside the call to executeAndClose().,"['dependency: (transaction(), wrapping the call inside, executeandclose())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (transaction(), wrapping the call inside, executeandclose())""]"
"As you can see a DaoManager class can solve the problems of marking both connection life span and transaction boundaries, and automatically open and close connections and commit / rollback transactions.",,[]
"If you implement a base event listener class that all event listeners (or actions, or whatever your framework calls them) extend, you can put the DaoManager code in that class (or a subclass of the base class).",,[]
Here is an example of a subclass that executes the persistence code marked in bold in the first code box in this section:,,[]
Now your domain logic class only contains the persistence code that is actually interesting.,,[]
It may not always be possible or feasible to implement such a persistence action base class.,,[]
It would be tempting to put that validation code inside the doPersistenceAction() method.,,[]
"But remember, a connection has been opened already when the DaoManager is instantiated, which happens before the doPersistenceAction() method is called.",,[]

You can write your own matchers and plug into the assertThat() method.,,[]
The static method matches() creates a new matcher and returns it.,,[]
You just embed the call to the static method matches() inside the assertThat() method.,,[]
In several situations mock testing is easier than testing with the real collaborators of a class.,,[]

"In the classpath element I add the output locations of my project code, and test code.",,[]
In the test element I declare which unit test class to execute.,,[]
The classpath stuff is the same as in the first example.,,[]

"So, I will take the concatenation logic and move into a separate class, which can be tested independent from the MyServlet class.",,[]
Notice how the concatenation logic has been moved to a class called MyConcatenator.,,[]
Notice how the concatenate() method only refers to a string array.,,[]
Notice again how it was not necessary to reference any servlet classes or interfaces in this unit test.,,[]
By real objects I mean the objects the tested unit (class) will be using in the real application.,,[]
"If you have a class Calculator, that needs a dao (Data Access Object) object to load the data it needs from a database, then the dao object is a ""real object"".","['dependency: (calculator, needs, data access object)']",[]

The RionWriter class has functionality that helps you reserve length bytes for composite RION fields and jump back up and fill them in correctly later.,,[]
One of the mechanisms in the RionWriter class that helps you reserve length bytes and set their value correctly later requires an internal stack to keep track of where the reserved length bytes are located.,,[]
Here is an example of setting the nested field stack for a RionWriter via its setNestedFieldStack() method:,,[]
"However, it is possible for all RION fields to take the value null, so it is possible to include e.g.",,[]
"The writeObjectBeginPush() method writes the beginning of the RION Object field, and reserves and reserve as many length bytes as you pass to it as parameter (2 in the example above).",,[]
"The writeObjectEndPop() method pops the RION Object field start index off the nested field stack, calculates the total length of the Object field and writes the total Object field length into its reserved length bytes.",,[]

"In the example above, when the throwsException() method is called, and it throws an exception, the statement below the throwsException() method call is never executed.",,[]
"In the example above, only one exception is caught, Exception which is the superclass of most exceptions.",,[]
"Rather than compute the .toUpperCase() value twice, by nesting them inside each if-statement, the uppercase version of aString is computed just once, and assigned to the variable aStringUC.",,[]
"You can thus use all the classes of the Java SDK's in Scala, and also your own, custom Java classes, or your favourite Java open source projects.",,[]
"Instead a Scala class can have what is called a singleton object, or sometime a companion object.",,[]
"When a singleton object is named the same as a class, it is called a companion object.",,[]

You can also run a Java verticle class which is located inside a JAR file.,"['containment: (java, is located inside, jar)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java, is located inside, jar)""]"
Sometimes you need a classpath which contains more than one directory or JAR file.,,[]

The end() method can take either a String or Buffer as parameter.,,[]
To close an HTTP server you simply call its close() method like this:,,[]

java.security.KeyStore example loads the KeyStore file located in the keystore.ks file,,[]
The queueObject.doWait() call is placed outside the synchronized(this) block to avoid nested monitor lockout so another thread can actually call unlock() when no thread is executing inside the synchronized(this) block in lock() method,"['dependency: (dowait(), call is placed outside, synchronized())', 'dependency: (unlock(), call when no thread executing inside, lock())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dowait(), call is placed outside, synchronized())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (unlock(), call when no thread executing inside, lock())""]"
The read() and write() calls on the streams are blocking meaning if you try to use the same thread to both read and write this may result in the thread deadlocking itself,"['dependency: (read(), block, write())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (read(), block, write())""]"
