Adding an element to a Collection is done via the add() method.,,[]
The Java Collection interface (java.util.Collection) is one of the root interfaces of the Java Collection API.,,[]
"The add() method adds the given element to the collection, and returns true if the Collection changed as a result of calling the add() method.",,[]
"On the other hand, if you called add() on a List and the List already contained that element, the element would then exist twice in the List.","['containment: (list, contains, add())', 'modification: (add(), adds element to, list)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, contains, add())""]"
"The remove() method removes the given element from the Collection and returns true if the removed element was present in the Collection, and was removed.",,[]
"If the element was not present, the remove() method returns false.",,[]
You can also add a collection of objects to a Java Collection using the addAll().,,[]
The Java Collection addAll() adds all elements found in the Collection passed as parameter to the method.,,[]
"If you had called add() with the Collection as parameter instead, the Collection object itself would have been added, not its elements.",,[]
Exactly how the addAll() method behaves depends on the Collection subtype.,,[]
The Java Collection removeAll() removes all elements found the Collection passed as parameter to the method.,,[]
"contains() returns true if the collection contains the element, and false if not.",,[]
"containsAll() returns true if the collection contains all the elements in the parameter collection, and false if not.",,[]
You can check the size of a collection using the size() method.,,[]
The Java Stream API provides a more functional programming approach to iterating and processing elements of e.g.,,[]
You obtain a stream from a collection by calling the stream() method of the given collection.,,[]
Then a Stream of strings is obtained by calling the items.stream() method.,,[]
"This is similar to how you obtain an Iterator by calling the items.iterator() method, but a Stream is a different animal than an Iterator.",,[]
The Predicate interface contains a function called test() which the lambda expression passed as parameter above is matched against.,"['containment: (predicate, contains, test())', 'reference: (test(), matched against, predicate)']","[""('interface', 'containment', 'method'): (predicate, contains, test())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'interface'): (test(), matched against, predicate)""]"
"If you look at the lambda expression above, you can see that it takes a single parameter item and returns a boolean - the result of the item.startsWith(""o"") method call.",,[]
"When you call the filter() method on a Stream, the filter passed as parameter to the filter() method is stored internally.",,[]
"The parameter passed to the filter() function determines what items in the stream should be processed, and which that should be excluded from the processing.",,[]
"If the Predicate.test() method of the parameter passed to filter() returns true for an item, that means it should be processed.","['check: (filter(), uses the result of, predicate.test())', 'dependency: (filter(), depends on, predicate.test())', 'access: (filter(), accesses, predicate.test())']","[""('method', 'check', 'method'): (filter(), uses the result of, predicate.test())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (filter(), depends on, predicate.test())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (filter(), accesses, predicate.test())""]"
The collect() method is one of the stream processing methods on the Stream interface.,"['dependency: (collect(), is one of the stream processing methods on, stream)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (collect(), is one of the stream processing methods on, stream)""]"
"The min() and max() methods return an Optional instance which has a get() method on, which you use to obtain the value.","['alternative: (min, can be used instead of, max)', 'dependency: (min, return optional instance which has a, get)', 'dependency: (max, return optional instance which has a, get)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (min, can be used instead of, max)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (min, return optional instance which has a, get)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (max, return optional instance which has a, get)""]"
In case the stream has no elements the get() method will return null.,,[]
The Comparator.comparing() method creates a Comparator based on the lambda expression passed to it.,,[]
"In fact, the comparing() method takes a Function which is a functional interface suited for lambda expressions.",,[]
The count() method simply returns the number of elements in the stream after filtering has been applied.,,[]
The count() method returns a long which is the count of elements in the stream after filtering etc.,,[]
The reduce() method can reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.,,[]
"The reduce() method takes a BinaryOperator as parameter, which can easily be implemented using a lambda expression.",,[]
The BinaryOperator.apply() method is the method implemented by the lambda expression above.,,[]
"Thus, the value created by the reduce() function is the accumulated value after processing the last element in the stream.",,[]
The reduce() method taking a BinaryOperator as parameter returns an Optional .,"['dependency: (reduce(), returns, optional)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (reduce(), returns, optional)""]"
"In case the stream contains no elements, the Optional.get() returns null.",,[]
"This version of the reduce() method returns the accumulated value directly, and not an Optional.",,[]
The reduce() method can be combined with the filter() method too.,"['dependency: (reduce(), can be combined with, filter())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (reduce(), can be combined with, filter())""]"
"The Java Collections class, java.util.Collections, contains a long list of utility methods for working with collections in Java.",,[]
The Java Collections addAll() method can add a variable number of elements to a Collection (typically either a List or a Set .,,[]
Here is a java code example of calling the Collections addAll() method:,,[]
The Collections binarySearch() method can search a Java List for an element using a binary search algorithm.,"['access: (collections.binarysearch(), search, list)', 'check: (collections.binarysearch(), can search, list)', 'containment: (list, for an element in, collections.binarysearch())']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (collections.binarysearch(), search, list)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, for an element in, collections.binarysearch())""]"
The List must be sorted in ascending order before you search it using binarySearch() .,,[]
Here is an example of searching a List using the Collections binarySearch() method:,,[]
The Collections copy() method can copy all elements of a List into another List.,"['transfer: (collections.copy(), copies all elements of, list)', 'containment: (list, contains, list)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (collections.copy(), copies all elements of, list)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (list, contains, list)""]"
Here is a Java example of calling the Collections copy() method:,,[]
The Collections reverse() method can reverse the elements in a Java List.,,[]
The Collections shuffle() method can shuffle the elements of a List.,,[]
Here is an example of shuffling a list with the Collections shuffle() method:,,[]
Here is an example of sorting a Java List using Collections sort() method:,,[]
The Java Collections copy() method can copy one List into another.,,[]
You provide the source and destination List instances as parameters to the copy() method.,,[]
The Collections min() method can find the minimum element in a List according to the natural ordering of the elements (see my Java List sorting tutorial).,"['access: (collections.min(), find the minimum element in, list)', 'containment: (list, contains, element)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (collections.min(), find the minimum element in, list)""]"
Here is an example of finding the minimum element in a Java List using Collections min() method:,,[]
The Collections max() method can find the maximum element in a List according to the natural order of the elements (see my Java List sorting tutorial).,,[]
The Java Collections replaceAll() method can replace all occurrences of one element with another element.,,[]
You pass the element to replace and the element to replace it with as parameters to the replaceAll() method.,,[]
"The Collections replaceAll() method returns true if any elements were replaced, and false if not.",,[]
The Collections replaceAll() method uses the equals() method of each element to determine if the element is equal to the element to replace or not.,"['dependency: (replaceall(), uses, equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (replaceall(), uses, equals())""]"
I have a written a few more details about how the equals() method works in my section about the Java equals() method.,,[]
The unmodifiableSet() method in the Java Collections class can create an immutable (unmodifiable) Set from a normal Java Set .,"['creation: (collections, create, set)', 'containment: (collections, in, set)', 'immutability: (unmodifiableset(), create immutable, set)', 'conversion: (unmodifiableset(), create unmodifiable from, set)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'interface'): (collections, create, set)"", ""('method', 'conversion', 'interface'): (unmodifiableset(), create unmodifiable from, set)""]"
"The Java Comparable interface,java.lang.Comparable, represents an object which can be compared to other objects.",,[]
Several of the built-in classes in Java implements the Java Comparable interface.,,[]
"You can also implement the Java Comparable interface yourself, to make your own classes comparable.",,[]
"When a class implements the Java Comparable interface, this means that instances (objects) of that class can be compared to each other, as mentioned above.",,[]
Please keep in mind that the Comparable interface is intended for comparison of objects of the same class.,,[]
In the following section I will explain how the compareTo() method works.,,[]
The Java Comparable compareTo() method takes a single object as parameter and returns an int value.,,[]
"The int returned signal whether the object the compareTo() method is called on is larger than, equal to or smaller than the parameter object.",,[]
"The Java Integer class implements the Comparable interface, so you can call compareTo() Here is an example:",,[]
Since the value 45 is smaller than 99 - the first comparison ( valA.compareTo(valB) = 45.compareTo(99) ) results in the value -1 being returned.,,[]
"In the second comparison, when 99 is compared to 45 ( valB.compareTo(valA) = 99.compareTo(45) ) the result is 1 - because 99 is larger than 45.",,[]
Here is an example of a Spaceship class which can compare itself to other Spaceship instances:,,[]
This way you can implement compareTo() to compare base on multiple factors.,,[]
"By specifying a type parameter when implementing the Comparable interface, the compareTo() method parameter changes from Object to whatever type you have specified.",,[]
"Notice how there is no type parameter specified after the ""implements Comparable"" interface in the class declaration.",,[]
"Notice also, how the parameter type of the compareTo() object is no longer Spaceship, but Object.","['reference: (compareto, parameter type, object)', 'dependency: (compareto, has parameter type, object)']","[""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (compareto, parameter type, object)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (compareto, has parameter type, object)""]"
"Finally, also notice how it is now necessary to cast the parameter of the compareTo() method to Spaceship explicitly.",,[]
"Notice too, that the compareTo() method should throw a NullPointerException if the parameter object is null.","['check: (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)', 'dependency: (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)', 'creation: (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)', 'implementation: (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)"", ""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (compareto(), throw, nullpointerexception)""]"
"Similarly, the compareTo() method should throw a ClassCastException if the input parameter is not of the same class as the class of the object compareTo() is called on.",,[]
You can just cast to the desired class (as in the example above).,,[]
"If the classes do not match, the Java VM will throw a ClassCastException.",,[]
"The Java Comparator interface, java.util.Comparator, represents a component that can compare two objects so they can be sorted using sorting functionality in Java.",,[]
When sorting e.g a Java List you can pass a Java Comparator to the sorting method.,"['dependency: (`java.util.list`, uses, `java.util.comparator`)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (`java.util.list`, uses, `java.util.comparator`)""]"
"This method, the compare() method, takes two objects which the Comparator implementation is intended to compare.",,[]
The compare() method returns an int which signals which of the two objects was larger.,,[]
Imagine you have the following Spaceship class that you would like to be able to compare instances of:,,[]
"Notice that the Spaceship class already implements the Comparable interface which compares Spaceship objects on spaceshipClass first, and then registrationNo.",,[]
"First, notice how the SpaceshipComparator class implements the Comparator interface with the type Spaceship specified inside the < > characters ( implements Comparator<Spaceship> ).",,[]
"Setting the generic type of the Comparator implementation to Spaceship means that the parameter types of the compare() method can be set to Spaceship, and not Object as it would have been - if no generic type had been specified ( implements Comparator ).",,[]
"A Java Comparator implementation is pretty much always specialized to be able to compare objects of a specific type (class), so specifying a generic type in your Comparator implementation almost always makes sense.",,[]
"Second, notice how the compare() method returns the registrationNo of the first Spaceship parameter compared to the registrationNo of the second Spaceship parameter.",,[]
"Imagine if the registrationNo variable of the Spaceship class was an int instead, so getRegistrationNo() would return an int.",,[]
"The Java Deque interface, java.util.Deque, represents a double ended queue, meaning a queue where you can add and remove elements to and from both ends of the queue.",,[]
The LinkedList class is a pretty standard Deque and Queue implementation.,"['implementation: (linkedlist, is a pretty standard implementation of, deque)', 'implementation: (linkedlist, is a pretty standard implementation of, queue)', 'alternative: (deque, and, queue)']",[]
The Java ArrayDeque class stores its elements internally in an array.,,[]
Before you can use a Java Deque you must create an instance of one of the classes that implements the Deque interface.,,[]
You add elements to the beginning end of a Deque using the add() method.,,[]
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the add() method will throw an exception.",,[]
"This is different from the offer() method, which will return false if it cannot insert the element.",,[]
The addLast() method also adds an element to the end (tail) of a Java Deque.,,[]
This is the Deque interface's equivalent of the add() method inherited from the Queue interface.,"['alternative: (deque, equivalent of, queue)', 'dependency: (deque, inherited from, queue)', 'reference: (deque, equivalent of the add() method inherited from, queue)']","[""('interface', 'alternative', 'interface'): (deque, equivalent of, queue)"", ""('interface', 'dependency', 'interface'): (deque, inherited from, queue)""]"
Here is an example of adding an element to a Java Deque instance using the addLast() method:,,[]
"If the element cannot be inserted into the Deque, the addLast() method will throw an exception.",,[]
This is different from the offerLast() method which will return false if the element cannot be added to the Deque.,,[]
To add an element at the beginning (head) instead of the end of a Java Deque you call the addFirst() method instead.,,[]
"If the element cannot be added to the beginning of the Deque, the addFirst() method will throw an exception.",,[]
This is different from the offerFirst() method which will return false if an element cannot be inserted in the beginning of the Deque.,,[]
The offer() method adds an element to the end (tail) of the Deque.,,[]
This is different from the add() method which will throw an exception is adding an element to the end of the Deque fails.,,[]

The purpose of this text was mostly to explain how they are used by the Java Collection classes.,,[]
"This means, that a class that implements the Java Iterable interface can have its elements iterated.",,[]
"You can iterate the objects of a Java Iterable in three ways: Via the , by obtaining a Java Iterator from the Iterable, or by calling the Java Iterable forEach() method.","['alternative: (iterable.foreach(), can be used instead of, iterator)', 'alternative: (iterable.foreach(), or by calling ... instead of, iterable)', 'access: (iterator, obtaining ... from, iterable)', 'dependency: (iterator, from, iterable)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (iterator, from, iterable)""]"
"Then it uses a for-each loop to iterate the elements of the List, and print out the toString() value of each element.",,[]
The second way you can iterate the elements of a Java Iterable is by obtaining a Java Iterator from it by calling the Iterable iterator() method.,,[]
The third way to iterate the elements of a Java Iterable is via its forEach() method.,,[]
Here is an example of iterating the elements of an Iterable via its forEach() method:,,[]
The Java Iterable interface (java.lang.Iterable) is one of the root interfaces of the Java Collections API.,,[]
"Therefore, there are several classes in Java that implements the Java Iterable interface.",,[]
You can obtain a Java Spliterator from a Java Iterable via its spliterator() method.,"['access: (iterable, obtain ... from, spliterator)', 'access: (iterable, via its ... method, spliterator)']",[]
"If you are writing some code that needs to iterate a collection lots of times in a tight loop, let's say iterate a Java List thousands of times per second, iterating the List via the Java for-each loop is slower than iterating the list via a standard for-loop as seen here: () .",,[]
"The reason the for-each loop is slower is, that each iteration will call the List iterator() method, which will create a new Iterator object.",,[]
The standard Java collection interface Collection contains a method called iterator().,"['access: (collection, contains a method called, iterator())', 'containment: (collection, contains, iterator())']",[]

"You can also obtain an Iterator from many of the Java Collection data structures, e.g.","['access: (iterator, obtain from, collection)', 'containment: (collection, java collection data structures, iterator)']",[]
The first method is the Iterator hasNext() method which returns true if the Iterator contains more elements.,,[]

If the Iterator has iterated over all elements in the underlying collection - the hasNext() method returns false.,,[]
The second method to pay attention to is the next() method.,,[]
The next() method returns the next element of the collection the Iterator is iterating over.,,[]
In that case you will get a ConcurrentModificationException the next time you call the Iterator next() method.,,[]
The Java Iterator interface has a remove() method which lets you remove the element just returned by next() from the underlying collection.,"['dependency: (remove(), relies on, next())', 'access: (remove(), removes the element returned by, next())', 'containment: (iterator, contains, remove())', 'containment: (iterator, contains, next())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (remove(), relies on, next())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (remove(), removes the element returned by, next())"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'method'): (iterator, contains, remove())"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'method'): (iterator, contains, next())""]"

"If the List is not typed, using Java Generics, then you can even mix objects of different types (classes) in the same List.",,[]
These List implementations are explained in more detail in my java.util.concurrent tutorial .,,[]
You create a List instance by creating an instance of one of the classes that implements the List interface.,,[]
"Remember, most often you will use the ArrayList class, but there can be cases where using one of the other implementations might make sense.",,[]
"Thus, you need to cast them to the concrete class (or interface) that you know the object to be of.",,[]
You insert elements (objects) into a Java List using its add() method.,,[]
Here is an example of adding elements to a Java List using the add() method:,,[]
The first three add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list.,,[]

The indexOf() method finds the index of the first occurrence in the List of the given element.,,[]
The lastIndexOf() method finds the index of the last occurrence in the List of a given element.,,[]
You can check if a Java List contains a given element using the List contains() method.,,[]

"Obviously, if the input parameter to contains() is null, the contains() method will not use the equals() method to compare against each element, but rather use the == operator.","['alternative: (contains(), will not use, equals())', 'dependency: (contains(), use, equals())', 'check: (contains(), compare against each element, equals())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (contains(), will not use, equals())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (contains(), use, equals())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (contains(), compare against each element, equals())""]"
The Java List interface contains a clear() method which removes all elements from the list when called.,"['containment: (list, contains, clear())', 'modification: (list, removes all elements from, clear())', 'implementation: (list, when called, clear())']",[]
Here is simple example of removing all elements from a List (clearing) with the clear() method:,,[]
"After the clear() method has been called, the List will be completely empty.",,[]
The Java List interface has a method called retainAll() which is capable of retaining all elements from one List which are also present in another List.,"['access: (retainall(), accesses, list)', 'containment: (list, contains, list)']",[]
"In other words, the retain() method removes all the elements from the target List which are not found in the other List.",,[]
Here is a Java example of calling the List retainAll() method:,,[]
"Third, the retainAll() method is called on list, passing otherList as parameter.",,[]
"After list.retainAll(otherList) has finished executing, the list will only contain those elements which were both present in list and otherList before retainAll() was called.",,[]
You can obtain the number of elements in the List by calling the size() method.,,[]
The Java List interface has a method called subList() which can create a new List with a subset of the elements from the original List.,"['creation: (sublist(), creates a new list with a subset of the elements from the original list, list)', 'containment: (list, has a method called, sublist())']",[]
The subList() method takes 2 parameters: A start index and and end index.,,[]
Here is a Java example of creating a sublist of elements from another List using the subList() method:,,[]
"After executing the list.subList(1,3) instruction the sublist will contain the elements at index 1 and 2.",,[]
"The list.subList(1,3) call will include index 1, but exclude index 3, thereby keeping the elements at index 1 and 2.",,[]
You can convert a Java List to a Java Array using the List toArray() method.,,[]
"Note that even if we pass a String array of size 0 to the toArray(), the array returned will have all the elements in the List in it.",,[]
It is the Arrays.asList() method that converts the array to a List.,,[]
You can sort a Java List using the Collections sort() method.,,[]
"If the List contains objects that implement the Comparable interface (java.lang.Comparable), then the objects can compare themselves to each other.",,[]
"The Java String class implements the Comparable interface, you can sort them in their natural order, using the Collections sort() method.","['dependency: (collections.sort(), uses, comparable)', 'example: (collections.sort(), sorts, string)', 'implementation: (string, implements, comparable)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (collections.sort(), uses, comparable)"", ""('method', 'example', 'class'): (collections.sort(), sorts, string)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (string, implements, comparable)""]"
"If the objects in the Java List do not implement the Comparable interface, or if you want to sort the objects in another order than their compare() implementation, then you need to use a Comparator implementation (java.util.Comparator).","['alternative: (java.util.comparator, use ... instead of, comparable)', 'alternative: (java.util.comparator, use a comparator implementation instead of their, compare())', 'dependency: (comparable, implement, compare())']","[""('interface', 'dependency', 'method'): (comparable, implement, compare())""]"
You obtain an Iterator by calling the iterator() method of the List interface.,"['access: (iterator(), obtain ... by calling the ... method of, list)']",[]
Once you have obtained an Iterator you can keep calling its hasNext() method until it returns false.,,[]
Calling hasNext() is done inside a while loop as you can see.,,[]
Inside the while loop you call the Iterator next() method of the Iterator interface to obtain the next element pointed to by the Iterator.,,[]
"Inside the for loop the example accesses the elements in the List via its get() method, passing the incrementing variable i as parameter.",,[]
"Again, if the List is typed using Java Generics to e.g.",,[]
"Hence, the compiler knows that only a String can be returned from the get() method.",,[]
Therefore you do not need to cast the element returned by get() to String.,"['conversion: (get(), cast to, string)', 'access: (get(), returned by, string)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (get(), returned by, string)""]"
Obtaining a Stream from a List in Java is done by calling the List stream() method.,,[]
It is the last line of this example that calls the List stream() method to obtain the Stream representing the elements in the List.,"['access: (stream(), obtain, list)', 'conversion: (list, representing the elements in, stream())']",[]
Once you have obtained a Stream from a List you can iterate the Stream by calling its forEach() method.,"['access: (foreach(), calling its, stream)', 'dependency: (foreach(), iterate, stream)', 'access: (stream, obtained from a, list)', 'conversion: (stream, from a, list)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (foreach(), calling its, stream)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (foreach(), iterate, stream)"", ""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (stream, from a, list)""]"
Here is an example of iterating the elements of a List using the Stream forEach() method:,,[]
"Calling the forEach() method will make the Stream iterate all the element of the Stream internally, and call the Consumer passed as parameter to the forEach() method for each element in the Stream.",,[]
"The Java Map interface, java.util.Map, represents a mapping between a key and a value.",,[]
To create a Java Map you must create an instance of one the classes that implement the Java Map interface.,,[]
To add elements to a Map you call its put() method.,,[]
The three put() calls maps a string value to a string key.,,[]
Here is an example of auto-boxing primitive parameters passed to the put() method:,,[]
The value passed to the put() method in the above example is a primitive int.,,[]
"Java auto-boxes it inside an Integer instance though, because the put() method requires an Oject instance as both key and value.","['dependency: (put(), requires, integer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (put(), requires, integer)""]"
Auto-boxing would also happen if you passed a primitive as key to the put() method.,,[]
"If you call put() more than once with the same key, the latest value passed to put() for that key will overwrite what is already stored in the Map for that key.",,[]
To obtain the value stored by the null key you call the get() method with null as parameter value.,,[]
Just keep in mind that you will get a null out when you call get() later with that key - so this will return null:,,[]
The Java Map interface has a method called putAll() which can copy all key + value pairs (entries) from another Map instance into itself.,,[]
Here is an example of copying all entries from one Java Map into another via putAll():,,[]
"Calling mapB.putAll(mapA) will only copy entries from mapA into mapB, not from mapB into mapA.",,[]
"To copy entries the other way, you would have to execute the code mapA.putAll(mapB).",,[]
"To get a specific element stored in a Java Map you call its get() method, passing along the key for that element as parameter.",,[]
"Notice that the get() method returns a Java Object, so we have to cast it to a String (because we know the value is a String).",,[]
"If we had specified a generic type for the key and value of the Map, then it would not have been necessary to cast the object returned by get() method.",,[]
The Java Map interface has a getOrDefault() method which can return a default value supplied by you - in case no value is stored in the Map by the given key.,,[]
"This example creates a Map and stores three values in it using the keys A, B and C. Then the example calls the Map getOrDefault() method, passing the String E as key, along with a default value - the String default value.",,[]
Since the Map does not contain any object stored by the key E the given default value will be returned - which is the String default value passed as the last parameter to the getOrDefault() method.,,[]
You can check if a Java Map contains a specific key using the containsKey() method.,,[]
You can iterate all the keys of a Java Map via its keySet() method.,,[]
"As you can see, the key Iterator returns every key stored in a Java Map, one by one (one for each call to next()).","['access: (iterator.next(), returns every key stored in, map)', 'dependency: (iterator.next(), one for each call to, map)']","[""('method', 'access', 'interface'): (iterator.next(), returns every key stored in, map)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (iterator.next(), one for each call to, map)""]"
"Once you have the key, you can obtain the element stored for that key using the Map get() method.",,[]
"In the example above, the Iterator next() method returns an Object - and so does the get() method.","['similarity: (next(), returns an object, get())', 'alternative: (next(), and so does, get())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (next(), returns an object, get())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (next(), and so does, get())""]"
Notice how a generic type is now also specified for the Iterator obtained from map.keySet().iterator().,"['access: (map.keyset(), obtained from, map.keyset().iterator())', 'creation: (map.keyset(), iterator obtained from, map.keyset().iterator())']","[""('method', 'access', 'method'): (map.keyset(), obtained from, map.keyset().iterator())"", ""('method', 'creation', 'method'): (map.keyset(), iterator obtained from, map.keyset().iterator())""]"
You obtain a Collection of the values stored in a Map via the values() method.,,[]
Notice how the key and value can be obtained from each Map.Entry instance.,,[]
You can remove all entries in a Java Map using the clear() method.,,[]
It is possible to replace an element in a Java Map using the replace() method.,,[]
The replace() method will only insert the new value if there is already an existing value mapped to the key.,,[]
"This is different from how put() works, which always insert the value no matter what.",,[]
Here is an example of replacing one value with another using the Java Map replace() method:,,[]
You can read the number of entries in a Java Map using the size() method.,,[]
The number of entries in a Java Map is also referred to as the Map size - hence the method name size() .,,[]
Here is an example of reading the number of entries in a Map using the size() method:,,[]
This method is called isEmpty() and it returns either true or false.,,[]
The isEmpty() method will return false if the Map instance contains 1 or more entries.,,[]
The Map compute() method takes a key object and a lambda expression as parameters.,,[]
Here is an example of calling the Java Map compute() method:,,[]
"The compute() method will call the lambda expression internally, passing the key object and whatever value is stored in the Map for that key object, as parameters to the lambda expression.",,[]
"In the example above you can see that the lambda expression checks if the value mapped to the given key is null or not, before calling toString().toUpperCase() on it.","['dependency: (tostring, before calling, touppercase)', 'check: (tostring, checks if the value ... is null or not before calling, touppercase)', 'conversion: (tostring, calling ... on, touppercase)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (tostring, before calling, touppercase)"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (tostring, checks if the value ... is null or not before calling, touppercase)""]"
"The Map computeIfAbsent() method works similarly to the compute() method, but the lambda expression is only called if no entry exists already for the given key.","['similarity: (computeifabsent, works similarly to, compute)', 'alternative: (computeifabsent, can be used instead of, compute)', 'dependency: (computeifabsent, relies on, compute)']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (computeifabsent, works similarly to, compute)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (computeifabsent, can be used instead of, compute)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (computeifabsent, relies on, compute)""]"
"However, the lambda expression could have calculated the value in any way it needed to - e.g.",,[]
"The Map merge() method takes a key, a value, and a lambda expression implementing the BiFunction interface as parameters.","['dependency: (merge(), implementing, bifunction)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (merge(), implementing, bifunction)""]"
"If the Map does not have an entry for the key, or if the value for the key is null, the value passed as parameter to the merge() method is inserted for the given key.",,[]
"The Java NavigableMap interface, java.util.NavigableMap, is a sub-interface of the Java SortedMap interface.","['dependency: (java.util.navigablemap, is a sub-interface of, java.util.sortedmap)', 'reference: (java.util.navigablemap, is a sub-interface of, java.util.sortedmap)', 'containment: (java.util.sortedmap, contains, java.util.navigablemap)']","[""('interface', 'dependency', 'interface'): (java.util.navigablemap, is a sub-interface of, java.util.sortedmap)"", ""('interface', 'containment', 'interface'): (java.util.sortedmap, contains, java.util.navigablemap)""]"

Here is an example of creating an instance of the Java TreeMap class which implements the NavigableMap interface:,"['implementation: (treemap, implements, navigablemap)', 'example: (treemap, is an example of, navigablemap)']",[]
The first interesting navigation method of NavigableMap is the descendingKeySet() method.,,[]
The descendingKeySet() method returns a NavigableSet in which the order of the elements is reversed compared to the original key set.,,[]
The descendingMap() method returns a NavigableMap which is a view of the original Map.,"['conversion: (descendingmap(), returns, navigablemap)', 'reference: (descendingmap(), is a view of, map)', 'containment: (navigablemap, is a view of, map)']","[""('method', 'reference', 'interface'): (descendingmap(), is a view of, map)""]"
"The headMap() method returns a view of the original NavigableMap which only contains elements that are ""less than"" the given element.",,[]

The subMap() allows you to pass two parameters demarcating the boundaries of the view map to return.,,[]

"The Java Properties class can write the key, value pairs to a properties file on disk, and read the properties back in again.",,[]
To use the Java Properties class you must first create a Properties instance.,"['creation: (properties, create, properties())']",[]
To set properties in a Java Properties instance you use the setProperty() method.,,[]

Notice the first line of the properties file is actually the comment that was passed as second parameter to the store() method call in the code example in the previous section about storing properties to a property file.,,[]
You can also load properties stored in a property file back into a Java Properties object via its load() method.,,[]

The Java Properties class has the ability to provide default property values for properties that do not have any key registered in the Properties instance.,,[]
The getProperty() method comes in a version that takes an extra parameter which is the default value to return in case the Properties instance does not contain a value for the given key.,,[]
Here is an example of calling getProperty() with a default value:,,[]

The lockWrite() method of a ReadWriteLock class shown below is an example of a test-and-set method.,"['example: (lockwrite(), method of, readwritelock)', 'dependency: (lockwrite(), of, readwritelock)', 'containment: (readwritelock, has method, lockwrite())']","[""('method', 'example', 'class'): (lockwrite(), method of, readwritelock)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (lockwrite(), of, readwritelock)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (readwritelock, has method, lockwrite())""]"
Threads calling lockWrite() first sets the state before the test (writeRequests++).,,[]
Then it tests the internal state against the access condition in the canGrantWriteAccess() method.,,[]
The BoundedSemaphore class shown below has two test-and-set methods: take() and release().,"['alternative: (take(), used instead of, release())', 'access: (take(), has, boundedsemaphore)', 'access: (release(), has, boundedsemaphore)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (take(), used instead of, release())"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (take(), has, boundedsemaphore)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (release(), has, boundedsemaphore)""]"
A typical example of a set method is the unlock() method of a Lock class.,,[]
Java 5 comes with blocking queue implementations in the java.util.concurrent package.,,[]
Notice how notifyAll() is only called from enqueue() and dequeue() if the queue size is equal to the size bounds (0 or limit).,"['implementation: (enqueue, called from, notifyall)', 'implementation: (dequeue, called from, notifyall)', 'check: (enqueue, queue size is equal to the size bounds before calling, dequeue)', 'check: (dequeue, queue size is equal to the size bounds before calling, enqueue)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (enqueue, called from, notifyall)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (dequeue, called from, notifyall)"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (enqueue, queue size is equal to the size bounds before calling, dequeue)"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (dequeue, queue size is equal to the size bounds before calling, enqueue)""]"
"If the queue size is not equal to either bound when enqueue() or dequeue() is called, there can be no threads waiting to either enqueue or dequeue items.","['alternative: (enqueue(), or, dequeue())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (enqueue(), or, dequeue())""]"
"As you can see, the lock() method first checks if the locked member variable is equal to false (check), and if it is it ses locked to true (then act).",,[]
"If multiple threads had access to the same MyLock instance, the above lock() function would not be guaranteed to work.",,[]
Here is the code example from earlier with the lock() method turned into an atomic block of code using the synchronized keyword:,,[]
Now the lock() method is synchronized so only one thread can executed it at a time on the same MyLock instance.,,[]
"The atomic lock() method is actually an example of ""compare and swap"".",,[]
"The lock() method compares the variable locked to the expected value false and if locked is equal to this expected value, it swaps the variable's value to true .",,[]
From Java 5 you can get access to these functions in the CPU via some of the new atomic classes in the java.util.concurrent.atomic package.,,[]
Here is an example showing how to implement the lock() method shown earlier using the AtomicBoolean class:,"['example: (lock(), implement using, atomicboolean)', 'implementation: (lock(), implemented with, atomicboolean)']","[""('method', 'example', 'class'): (lock(), implement using, atomicboolean)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (lock(), implemented with, atomicboolean)""]"
"This class has a compareAndSet() function which will compare the value of the AtomicBoolean instance to an expected value, and if has the expected value, it swaps the value with a new value.",,[]
"The compareAndSet() method returns true if the value was swapped, and false if not.",,[]
Many of the concurrency utilities in the java.util.concurrent Java package are designed for use with this model.,,[]
Non-blocking IO means that when a worker starts an IO operation (e.g.,,[]
"When the IO operation finishes, the result of the IO operation ( e.g.",,[]
It just needs to know what channel to forward the job to (or send the message to etc.).,,[]
"The main disadvantage of the assembly line concurrency model is that the execution of a job is often spread out over multiple workers, and thus over multiple classes in your project.",,[]
"Of course parallel worker code may also be spread over many different classes, but the execution sequence is often easier to read from the code.",,[]
With Java 7 we got the java.util.concurrent package contains the ForkAndJoinPool which can help you implement something similar to functional parallelism.,"['containment: (java.util.concurrent, contains, forkandjoinpool)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.util.concurrent, contains, forkandjoinpool)""]"
"However, if the system is concurrently executing multiple other tasks (like e.g.",,[]
when a Java application is started its main() method is executed by the main thread - a special thread that is created by the Java VM to run your application.,,[]
"Threads are instances of class java.lang.Thread, or instances of subclasses of this class.",,[]
"To start the Java thread you will call its start() method, like this:",,[]
The first is to create a subclass of Thread and override the run() method.,"['dependency: (run(), override, thread)', 'implementation: (run(), subclass of, thread)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (run(), override, thread)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (run(), subclass of, thread)""]"
The second method is to pass an object that implements Runnable (java.lang.Runnable to the Thread constructor.,,[]
"The first way to specify what code a thread is to run, is to create a subclass of Thread and override the run() method.",,[]
The run() method is what is executed by the thread after you call start().,"['dependency: (run(), executed by ... after you call, start())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), executed by ... after you call, start())""]"
The start() call will return as soon as the thread is started.,,[]
The run() method will execute as if executed by a different CPU.,,[]
"When the run() method executes it will print out the text ""MyThread running"".",,[]
You can also create an anonymous subclass of Thread like this:,,[]
"This example will print out the text ""Thread running"" once the run() method is executed by the new thread.",,[]
The second way to specify what code a thread should run is by creating a class that implements the java.lang.Runnable interface.,,[]
Whatever the thread is supposed to do when it executes must be included in the implementation of the run() method.,,[]
The first way to implement the Java Runnable interface is by creating your own Java class that implements the Runnable interface.,,[]
Here is an example of a custom Java class that implements the Runnable interface:,,[]
"After printing that text, the run() method exits, and the thread running the run() method will stop.","['dependency: (run(), exits after, print())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), exits after, print())""]"
Here is an example of an anonymous Java class that implements the Runnable interface:,,[]
"Apart from being an anononymous class, this example is quite similar to the example that used a custom class to implement the Runnable interface.",,[]
"To have the run() method executed by a thread, pass an instance of a class, anonymous class or lambda expression that implements the Runnable interface to a Thread in its constructor.","['dependency: (run(), executed by, thread)', 'implementation: (run(), implements, runnable)', 'dependency: (thread, pass ... to, runnable)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (run(), executed by, thread)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'interface'): (run(), implements, runnable)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (thread, pass ... to, runnable)""]"
When the thread is started it will call the run() method of the MyRunnable instance instead of executing it's own run() method.,,[]
Sometimes you may have to implement Runnable as well as subclass Thread.,"['alternative: (runnable, implement ... as well as subclass, thread)', 'implementation: (runnable, implement, thread)']","[""('interface', 'alternative', 'class'): (runnable, implement ... as well as subclass, thread)""]"
"For instance, if creating a subclass of Thread that can execute more than one Runnable.","['dependency: (thread, can execute more than one, runnable)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (thread, can execute more than one, runnable)""]"
"When creating and starting a thread a common mistake is to call the run() method of the Thread instead of start(), like this:","['alternative: (run(), instead of, start())', 'replacement: (run(), instead of, start())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (run(), instead of, start())""]"
At first you may not notice anything because the Runnable's run() method is executed like you expected.,,[]
Instead the run() method is executed by the thread that created the thread.,,[]
"To have the run() method of the MyRunnable instance called by the new created thread, newThread, you MUST call the newThread.start() method.","['dependency: (run(), must call, start())', 'implementation: (run(), called by, start())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), must call, start())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (run(), called by, start())""]"
"For instance, if multiple threads write to System.out it can be handy to see which thread wrote the text.",,[]
"Notice however, that since the MyRunnable class is not a subclass of Thread, it does not have access to the getName() method of the thread executing it.",,[]
The Thread.currentThread() method returns a reference to the Thread instance executing currentThread() .,,[]
First it prints out the name of the thread executing the main() method.,,[]
"Note that even if the threads are started in sequence (1, 2, 3 etc.)",,[]
"they may not execute sequentially, meaning thread 1 may not be the first thread to write its name to System.out.",,[]
A thread can pause itself by calling the static method Thread.sleep() .,,[]
The sleep() method will attempt to sleep that number of milliseconds before resuming execution.,,[]
"The Thread sleep() is not 100% precise, but it is pretty good still.",,[]
Here is an example of pausing a Java thread for 3 seconds (3.000 millliseconds) by calling the Thread sleep() method:,,[]
"The thread executing the Java code above, will sleep for approximately 10 seconds (10.000 milliseconds).",,[]
"The Java Thread class contains a stop() method, but it is deprecated.","['replacement: (thread, contains a deprecated, stop())']",[]
The original stop() method would not provide any guarantees about in what state the thread was stopped.,,[]
Instead of calling the stop() method you will have to implement your thread code so it can be stopped.,,[]
Here is an example of a class that implements Runnable which contains an extra method called doStop() which signals to the Runnable to stop.,"['implementation: (runnable, signals to stop, dostop())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (runnable, signals to stop, dostop())""]"
The doStop() is intended to be called from another thread than the thread executing the MyRunnable's run() method.,"['implementation: (dostop(), called from another thread than, run())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (dostop(), called from another thread than, run())""]"
The keepRunning() method is called internally by the thread executing the MyRunnable's run() method.,"['dependency: (run(), is called internally by, keeprunning())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), is called internally by, keeprunning())""]"
As long as doStop() has not been called the keepRunning() method will return true - meaning the thread executing the run() method will keep running.,"['dependency: (keeprunning(), will return true based on dostop(), dostop())', 'dependency: (run(), will keep running based on dostop(), dostop())', 'dependency: (run(), will keep running based on keeprunning(), keeprunning())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (keeprunning(), will return true based on dostop(), dostop())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), will keep running based on dostop(), dostop())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (run(), will keep running based on keeprunning(), keeprunning())""]"
"Here is an example of starting a Java thread that executes an instance of the above MyRunnable class, and stopping it again after a delay:",,[]
"Then the thread executing the main() method (the main thread) sleeps for 10 seconds, and then calls the doStop() method of the MyRunnable instance.","['implementation: (main(), calls, dostop())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (main(), calls, dostop())""]"
"This will cause the thread executing the MyRunnable method to stop, because the keepRunning() will return false after doStop() has been called.","['dependency: (keeprunning(), return false after called, dostop())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (keeprunning(), return false after called, dostop())""]"
Please keep in mind that if your Runnable implementation needs more than just the run() method (e.g.,,[]
"a stop() or pause() method too), then you can no longer create your Runnable implementation with a Java lambda expression.","['alternative: (stop(), or, pause())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (stop(), or, pause())""]"
"Instead you must use a custom class, or a custom interface that extends Runnable which has the extra methods, and which is implemented by an anonymous class.",,[]
You will have to create a custom lock class or use one of the Java 5 concurrency constructs in the java.util.concurrency package.,,[]
"Every time a thread takes a lock it is noted in a data structure (map, graph etc.)",,[]
Here is an example of a TreeNode class that call synchronized methods in different instances:,,[]
"If a thread (1) calls the parent.addChild(child) method at the same time as another thread (2) calls the child.setParent(parent) method, on the same parent and child instances, a deadlock can occur.","['dependency: (parent.addchild(), deadlock, child.setparent())', 'implementation: (parent.addchild(), calls, child.setparent())', 'similarity: (parent.addchild(), same time, child.setparent())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (parent.addchild(), deadlock, child.setparent())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (parent.addchild(), calls, child.setparent())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (parent.addchild(), same time, child.setparent())""]"
Here is some pseudo code that illustrates this: Thread 1: parent.addChild(child); //locks parent --> child.setParentOnly(parent); Thread 2: child.setParent(parent); //locks child --> parent.addChildOnly() First thread 1 calls parent.addChild(child).,"['dependency: (addchild(), calls, setparentonly())', 'implementation: (addchild(), calls, setparentonly())', 'dependency: (addchild(), calls, setparent())', 'implementation: (addchild(), calls, setparent())', 'dependency: (addchild(), calls, addchildonly())', 'implementation: (addchild(), calls, addchildonly())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, setparentonly())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, setparentonly())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, setparent())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, setparent())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, addchildonly())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (addchild(), calls, addchildonly())""]"
Since addChild() is synchronized thread 1 effectively locks the parent object for access from other treads.,,[]
Since setParent() is synchronized thread 2 effectively locks the child object for acces from other threads.,,[]
"Next thread 1 tries to call child.setParentOnly() method, but the child object is locked by thread 2, so the method call just blocks.",,[]

By far the best book on the java.util.concurrent package in Java 5 and forward.,,[]
"https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/ The LMAX Disrupter concurrent data structure (a single reader, single writer queue-like structure with high concurrency).",,[]
In the following code example I have created an example of such a communication mechanism - a Java class called FrameExchanger.,,[]
It is not important how this class looks in order to understand how the FrameExchanger works.,,[]
"The producing thread will call storeFrame() continuously, and the drawing thread will call takeFrame() continuously.","['implementation: (storeframe(), call continuously, takeframe())', 'transfer: (storeframe(), frame, takeframe())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (storeframe(), call continuously, takeframe())"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'method'): (storeframe(), frame, takeframe())""]"
Notice how the three instructions inside the storeFrame() method seem like they do not depend on each other.,,[]
"That means, that if the drawing thread is waiting in the while-loop in the takeFrame() method, the drawing thread could exit that while-loop, and take the old Frame object.",,[]
Notice that the first instruction is a read of a volatile variable (other.volatileVarC).,,[]
"When other.volatileVarC is read in from main memory, the other.nonVolatileB and other.nonVolatileA are also read in from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why this guarantee is necessary, let us modify the FrameExchanger class from earlier in this tutorial to have the hasNewFrame variable be declared volatile:",,[]
"Additionally, every time the drawing thread reads the hasNewFrame variable in the while-loop inside the takeFrame() method, the frame and framesStoredCount will also be refreshed from main memory.",,[]
"Imagine if the Java VM reordered the instructions inside the storeFrame() method, like this:",,[]
"This means, that the drawing thread executing the takeFrame() method may exit the while-loop before the new value is assigned to the frame variable.",,[]
"As you can see, the reordering of the instructions inside storeFrame() method may make the application malfunction.",,[]
"In the case of the storeFrame() method that means that the two first write instructions cannot be reordered to happen after the last write to hasNewFrame, since hasNewFrame is a volatile variable.",,[]
"This reordering does not break the code in the takeFrame() method, as the frame variable is still written to before the hasNewFrame variable is written to.",,[]
"Because of the volatile read visibility guarantee, when this.volatileVarA is read from main memory, so are all other variables visible to the thread at that time.",,[]
"Thus, this.nonVolatileVarB and this.nonVolatileVarC are also read in from main memory at the same time.",,[]
"With regards to the takeFrame() method, the first read of a volatile variable is the read of the hasNewFrame field inside the while-loop.",,[]
Notice the two synchronized blocks inside the set() and get() method.,"['dependency: (set(), synchronized blocks inside, get())', 'access: (set(), inside, get())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (set(), synchronized blocks inside, get())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (set(), inside, get())""]"
In the set() method the synchronized block at the end of the method will force all the variables to be synchronized to main memory after being updated.,,[]
In the get() method the synchronized block is placed at the beginning of the method.,,[]
"When the thread calling get() enters the synchronized block, all variables are re-read in from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why, I will use the get() method of the ValueExchanger shown earlier:",,[]
"As you can see, the synchronized block at the beginning of the method will guarantee that all of the variables this.valC, this.valB and this.valA are refreshed (read in) from main memory.",,[]
"To illustrate why, I will use the set() method of the ValueExchanger shown earlier:",,[]
"As you can see, the synchronized block at the end of the method will guarantee that all of the changed variables this.valA, this.valB and this.valC will be written back to (flushed) to main memory when the thread calling set() exits the synchronized blocks.",,[]
"The original Java memory model was insufficient, so the Java memory model was revised in Java 1.5.",,[]
Static class variables are also stored on the heap along with the class definition.,,[]
If two threads were executing the run() method then the diagram shown earlier would be the outcome.,,[]
methodOne() declares a primitive local variable (localVariable1 of type int) and an local variable which is an object reference (localVariable2).,,[]
Each thread executing methodOne() will create its own copy of localVariable1 and localVariable2 on their respective thread stacks.,,[]
Each thread executing methodOne() will also create their own copy of localVariable2.,,[]
The localVariable1 reference will be stored in one copy per thread executing methodTwo().,,[]
The Integer objects created inside methodTwo() correspond to Object 1 and Object 5 in the diagram above.,,[]
Notice also the two member variables in the class MySharedObject of type long which is a primitive type.,,[]
That is why Java 5 got a whole set of concurrency utility classes to help developers implement more fine grained concurrency control than what you get with synchronized.,,[]
Notice the use of the synchronized keyword in the add() method declaration.,,[]
Also here the synchronized keyword tells Java that the add() method is synchronized.,,[]
Synchronized static methods are synchronized on the class object of the class the synchronized static method belongs to.,,[]
"Since only one class object exists in the Java VM per class, only one thread can execute inside a static synchronized method in the same class.",,[]
"In case a class contains more than one static synchronized method, only one thread can execute inside any of these methods at the same time.",,[]
Only one thread can execute inside any of the two add() and subtract() methods at any given time.,"['alternative: (add(), can execute instead of, subtract())', 'alternative: (subtract(), can execute instead of, add())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (add(), can execute instead of, subtract())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (subtract(), can execute instead of, add())""]"
If Thread A is executing add() then Thread B cannot execute neither add() nor subtract() until Thread A has exited add().,"['dependency: (add(), cannot execute until exited, subtract())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (add(), cannot execute until exited, subtract())""]"
"If the static synchronized methods are located in different classes, then one thread can execute inside the static synchronized methods of each class.",,[]
One thread per class regardless of which static synchronized method it calls.,,[]
These methods are synchronized on the class object of the class the methods belong to:,,[]
"Had the second synchronized block been synchronized on a different object than MyClass.class, then one thread could execute inside each method at the same time.",,[]
It is even possible to use synchronized blocks inside a Java Lambda Expression as well as inside anonymous classes.,,[]
Notice that the synchronized block is synchronized on the class object of the class containing the lambda expression.,,[]
"It could have been synchronized on another object too, if that would have made more sense (given a specific use case), but using the class object is fine for this example.",,[]
"Here are the two classes used in the example above, Counter and CounterThread.","['example: (counter, used in the example above, counterthread)', 'example: (counterthread, used in the example above, counter)']","[""('class', 'example', 'class'): (counter, used in the example above, counterthread)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (counterthread, used in the example above, counter)""]"
"The Counter.add() method is synchronized on the instance, because the add method is an instance method, and marked as synchronized.",,[]
Therefore only one of the threads can call the add() method at a time.,,[]
"The other thread will wait until the first thread leaves the add() method, before it can execute the method itself.",,[]
"If the two threads had referenced two separate Counter instances, there would have been no problems calling the add() methods simultaneously.",,[]
Calling add() on counterA will thus not block a call to add() on counterB.,,[]
Without the use of the synchronized keyword (or the Java volatile keyword) there is no guarantee that when one thread changes the value of a variable shared with other threads (e.g.,,[]
"If you call Integer.valueOf(1) multiple times, it might actually return the same wrapper object instance for the same input parameter values.",,[]
"That means, that if you are synchronizing multiple blocks on the same primitive wrapper object (e.g.",,[]
"use Integer.valueOf(1) multiple times as monitor object), then you risk that those synchronized blocks all get synchronized on the same object.",,[]
"To be on the safe side, synchronize on this - or on a new Object() .",,[]
Java actually comes with a built in ReadWriteLock class you can use.,,[]
Java actually comes with a built-in Java Semaphore class you can use.,,[]
Just focus on how inside the synchronized block inside the count() method calls the count() method recursively.,"['dependency: (count(), calls recursively, count())', 'reference: (count(), calls, count())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (count(), calls recursively, count())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (count(), calls, count())""]"
"Thus, the thread calling count() may eventually enter the same synchronized block multiple times.",,[]
The Java ThreadLocal class enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread.,,[]
"Thus, the Java ThreadLocal class provides a simple way to make code thread safe that would not otherwise be so.",,[]
Once a ThreadLocal has been created you can set the value to be stored in it using its set() method.,,[]
You read the value stored in a ThreadLocal using its get() method.,,[]
"Additionally, you do not have to typecast the value returned by get().",,[]
It is possible to set an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal which will get used the first time get() is called - before set() has been called with a new value.,"['dependency: (threadlocal.get(), called before, threadlocal.set())', 'access: (threadlocal.get(), used the first time, threadlocal.set())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (threadlocal.get(), called before, threadlocal.set())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (threadlocal.get(), used the first time, threadlocal.set())""]"
The first way to specify an initial value for a Java ThreadLocal variable is to create a subclass of ThreadLocal which overrides its initialValue() method.,"['access: (threadlocal, overrides, initialvalue())', 'creation: (threadlocal, specify an initial value, initialvalue())']",[]
"The easiest way to create a subclass of ThreadLocal is to simply create an anonymous subclass, right where you create the ThreadLocal variable.","['creation: (threadlocal, create a subclass of, thread)', 'alternative: (threadlocal, subclass of, thread)', 'containment: (threadlocal, anonymous subclass of, thread)', 'creation: (threadlocal, create, threadlocal variable)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (threadlocal, create a subclass of, thread)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (threadlocal, subclass of, thread)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (threadlocal, anonymous subclass of, thread)""]"

Thread synchronization can also be achieved using other synchronization constructs like locks or atomic variables like java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.,,[]

In a classic multi-threaded architecture you will typically assign each task to a separate thread for execution.,,[]
A classic multi-threaded architecture can also sometimes lead to congestion when multiple threads try to access the same data structure at the same time.,,[]
The alternative to a classic multithreaded architecture is a single-threaded or same-threaded.,,[]

The missed signals problems is the reason that the FairLock implementation shown in the text Starvation and Fairness has turned the QueueObject class into a semaphore with two methods: doWait() and doNotify().,,[]

A simple implementation of the Lock class could look like this:,,[]
"If you look at the Synchronizer class above and look into this Lock implementation you will notice that threads are now blocked trying to access the lock() method, if more than one thread calls lock() simultanously.",,[]

"Exactly how I arrived at this design beginning from the previous Lock class is a longer story involving several incremental design steps, each fixing the problem of the previous step: Nested Monitor Lockout, Slipped Conditions, and Missed Signals.",,[]
"What is important is, that every thread calling lock() is now queued, and only the first thread in the queue is allowed to lock the FairLock instance, if it is unlocked.",,[]
First you might notice that the lock() method is no longer declared synchronized.,,[]
FairLock creates a new instance of QueueObject and enqueue it for each thread calling lock().,,[]
"The thread calling unlock() will take the top QueueObject in the queue and call doNotify() on it, to awaken the thread waiting on that object.",,[]
The doWait() and doNotify() methods store the signal internally in the QueueObject.,,[]
"This is done to avoid missed signals caused by a thread being preempted just before calling queueObject.doWait(), by another thread which calls unlock() and thereby queueObject.doNotify().",,[]
"The queueObject.doWait() call is placed outside the synchronized(this) block to avoid nested monitor lockout, so another thread can actually call unlock() when no thread is executing inside the synchronized(this) block in lock() method.",,[]
"Finally, notice how the queueObject.doWait() is called inside a try - catch block.",,[]
"In case an InterruptedException is thrown the thread leaves the lock() method, and we need to dequeue it.",,[]
If you compare the Lock and FairLock classes you will notice that there is somewhat more going on inside the lock() and unlock() in the FairLock class.,,[]
Threads waiting on an object (called wait() on it) remain waiting indefinitely,,[]
"In a desktop app the foreground thread (UI thread) could be responding to the user events - a.g. opening a file, or downloading a file, or saving a file etc.",,[]
"Each thread consumes a certain amount of computer resources, such as memory (RAM), so if you have too many threads active at the same time, the total amount of resources (e.g.",,[]
RAM) that is consumed may cause the computer to slow down - e.g.,,[]
"Java comes with built in thread pools in the java.util.concurrent package, so you don't have to implement your own thread pool.",,[]
You can read more about it in my text on the java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.,,[]
"Below here is the PoolThreadRunnable class which implements the Runnable interface, so it can be executed by a Java thread:",,[]
"A ThreadPool class which is the public interface to the thread pool, and a PoolThread class which implements the threads that execute the tasks.",,[]
To execute a task the method ThreadPool.execute(Runnable r) is called with a Runnable implementation as parameter.,,[]
Then each thread in the pool is stopped by calling doStop() on each thread.,,[]
Notice how the execute() method will throw an IllegalStateException if execute() is called after stop() has been called.,,[]
"This makes sure that a thread blocked in a wait() call inside the taskQueue.dequeue() call breaks out of the wait() call, and leaves the dequeue() method call with an InterruptedException thrown.",,[]
"This exception is caught in the PoolThread.run() method, reported, and then the isStopped variable is checked.",,[]
"Since isStopped is now true, the PoolThread.run() will exit and the thread dies.",,[]
"Notice how the add() method returns a new ImmutableValue instance with the result of the add operation, rather than adding the value to itself.",,[]
Notice how it is possible to change that reference through both the setValue() and add() methods.,,[]
"Therefore, even if the Calculator class uses an immutable object internally, it is not itself immutable, and therefore not thread safe.",,[]
"In other words: The ImmutableValue class is thread safe, but the use of it is not.",,[]
"To make the Calculator class thread safe you could have declared the getValue(), setValue(), and add() methods synchronized.",,[]
"The LocalObject instance in this example is not returned from the method, nor is it passed to any other objects that are accessible from outside the someMethod() method.",,[]
Each thread executing the someMethod() method will create its own LocalObject instance and assign it to the localObject reference.,,[]
"Even if the LocalObject instance is passed as parameter to other methods in the same class, or in other classes, the use of it is thread safe.",,[]
If two threads call the add() method simultaneously on the same NotThreadSafe instance then it leads to race conditions.,,[]
"Therefore, when they call the add() method on the NotThreadSafe instance it leads to race condition.",,[]
"However, if two threads call the add() method simultaneously on different instances then it does not lead to race condition.",,[]
"In other words, it is waiting for a signal from thread A which causes hasDataToProcess() to return true.",,[]
Notice how the while loop keeps executing until hasDataToProcess() returns true.,,[]
"The class java.lang.Object defines three methods, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), to facilitate this.",,[]
A thread that calls wait() on any object becomes inactive until another thread calls notify() on that object.,,[]
In order to call either wait() or notify the calling thread must first obtain the lock on that object.,,[]
"In other words, the calling thread must call wait() or notify() from inside a synchronized block.",,[]
Here is a modified version of MySignal called MyWaitNotify that uses wait() and notify().,,[]
"The waiting thread would call doWait(), and the notifying thread would call doNotify().",,[]
"When a thread calls notify() on an object, one of the threads waiting on that object are awakened and allowed to execute.",,[]
There is also a notifyAll() method that will wake all threads waiting on a given object.,,[]
As you can see both the waiting and notifying thread calls wait() and notify() from within a synchronized block.,,[]
"A thread cannot call wait(), notify() or notifyAll() without holding the lock on the object the method is called on.",,[]
Will the waiting thread not block the notifying thread from ever entering the synchronized block in doNotify()?,,[]
Once a thread calls wait() it releases the lock it holds on the monitor object.,,[]
"This allows other threads to call wait() or notify() too, since these methods must be called from inside a synchronized block.",,[]
Once a thread is awakened it cannot exit the wait() call until the thread calling notify() has left its synchronized block.,,[]
"In other words: The awakened thread must reobtain the lock on the monitor object before it can exit the wait() call, because the wait call is nested inside a synchronized block.",,[]
"If multiple threads are awakened using notifyAll() only one awakened thread at a time can exit the wait() method, since each thread must obtain the lock on the monitor object in turn before exiting wait().",,[]
The methods notify() and notifyAll() do not save the method calls to them in case no threads are waiting when they are called.,,[]
"Therefore, if a thread calls notify() before the thread to signal has called wait(), the signal will be missed by the waiting thread.",,[]
To avoid losing signals they should be stored inside the signal class.,,[]
Notice how the doNotify() method now sets the wasSignalled variable to true before calling notify().,,[]
"Also, notice how the doWait() method now checks the wasSignalled variable before calling wait().",,[]
In fact it only calls wait() if no signal was received in between the previous doWait() call and this.,,[]
For inexplicable reasons it is possible for threads to wake up even if notify() and notifyAll() has not been called.,,[]
If a spurious wakeup occurs in the MyWaitNofity2 class's doWait() method the waiting thread may continue processing without having received a proper signal to do so!,,[]
Notice how the wait() call is now nested inside a while loop instead of an if-statement.,,[]
"The while loop is also a nice solution if you have multiple threads waiting, which are all awakened using notifyAll(), but only one of them should be allowed to continue.",,[]
"Only one thread at a time will be able to obtain the lock on the monitor object, meaning only one thread can exit the wait() call and clear the wasSignalled flag.",,[]
"Once this thread then exits the synchronized block in the doWait() method, the other threads can exit the wait() call and check the wasSignalled member variable inside the while loop.",,[]
"An earlier version of this text had an edition of the MyWaitNotify example class which used a constant string ( """" ) as monitor object.",,[]
"The problem with calling wait() and notify() on the empty string, or any other constant string is, that the JVM/Compiler internally translates constant strings into the same object.",,[]
This also means that threads calling doWait() on the first MyWaitNotify instance risk being awakened by doNotify() calls on the second MyWaitNotify instance.,,[]
"Remember, that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance, the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances.",,[]
"A doNotify() call on the MyWaitNotify 1 may wake threads waiting in MyWaitNotify 2, but the signal will only be stored in MyWaitNotify 1.",,[]
"After all, if doNotify() is called on the second MyWaitNotify instance all that can really happen is that Thread A and B are awakened by mistake.",,[]
"This awakened thread (A or B) will check its signal in the while loop, and go back to waiting because doNotify() was not called on the first MyWaitNotify instance, in which they are waiting.",,[]
"The problem is, that since the doNotify() call only calls notify() and not notifyAll(), only one thread is awakened even if 4 threads are waiting on the same string instance (the empty string).",,[]
"If the doNotify() method had called notifyAll() instead of notify(), all waiting threads had been awakened and checked for signals in turn.",,[]
"Thread A and B would have gone back to waiting, but one of either C or D would have noticed the signal and left the doWait() method call.",,[]
"The other of C and D would go back to waiting, because the thread discovering the signal clears it on the way out of doWait().",,[]
"You may be tempted then to always call notifyAll() instead notify(), but this is a bad idea performance wise.",,[]
"For instance, each MyWaitNotify3 (example from earlier sections) instance has its own MonitorObject instance rather than using the empty string for wait() / notify() calls.",,[]

"Thus, at most N threads can pass the acquire() method without any release() calls, where N is the number of permits the semaphore was initialized with.","['dependency: (acquire(), without any, release())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (acquire(), without any, release())""]"
"If you use a semaphore to send signals between threads, then you would typically have one thread call the acquire() method, and the other thread to call the release() method.","['implementation: (acquire(), call ... and ... call, release())', 'dependency: (acquire(), then you would typically have one thread call ... and the other thread to call, release())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (acquire(), call ... and ... call, release())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (acquire(), then you would typically have one thread call ... and the other thread to call, release())""]"
"If no permits are available, the acquire() call will block until a permit is released by another thread.",,[]
"Similarly, a release() calls is blocked if no more permits can be released into this semaphore.",,[]
"For instance, if acquire was called after Thread 1 had inserted an object in a shared list, and Thread 2 had called release() just before taking an object from that list, you had essentially created a blocking queue.","['dependency: (acquire, called after, release())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (acquire, called after, release())""]"
"That is, there is no guarantee that the first thread to call acquire() is also the first thread to obtain a permit.",,[]
"If you want to enforce fairness, the Semaphore class has a constructor that takes a boolean telling if the semaphore should enforce fairness.",,[]
Calling this class a queue is a bit of an overstatement.,,[]
"However, unless you need to specify all these parameters explicitly for your ThreadPoolExecutor, it is often easier to use one of the factory methods in the java.util.concurrent.Executors class, as shown in the ExecutorService text.","['alternative: (java.util.concurrent.threadpoolexecutor, easier to use java.util.concurrent.executors instead of, java.util.concurrent.executors)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.concurrent.threadpoolexecutor, easier to use java.util.concurrent.executors instead of, java.util.concurrent.executors)""]"
"A Java Certificate class instance contains name plus other details of the entity it identifies, plus possibly a digital signature from a Certificate Authority (CA).",,[]
"The Java Certificate class is an abstract class, so while you may use Certificate as variable type, your variable will always point to a subclass of Certificate.",,[]
The Java Certificate class has one subclass - the X509Certificate class.,"['dependency: (x509certificate, subclass, certificate)']",[]
This class represents an X.509 certificate which is used as identity certificate in HTTPS and TLS.,"['alternative: (https, used as identity certificate in, tls)', 'example: (https, and, tls)', 'similarity: (https, and, tls)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (https, used as identity certificate in, tls)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (https, and, tls)"", ""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (https, and, tls)""]"
The Java Certificate getEncoded() method returns an encoded version of the Certificate as a byte array.,,[]
"For instance, if the Certificate is an X509Certificate the returned byte array will contain an X.590 (ASN.1 DER) encoded version of the Certificate instance.",,[]
The Java Certificate getPublicKey() method returns the PublicKey of this Certificate instance.,,[]
The Java Certificate getType() method returns the type of the Certificate instance.,,[]
The Java CertificateFactory class (java.security.cert.CertificateFactory) is capable of creating Java Certificate instances from binary certificate encodings like X.509 (ASN.1 DER).,,[]
"To read more about the Java Certificate class, see the Java Certificate tutorial.",,[]
See the Java CertPath tutorial for more information about the CertPath class.,,[]
This example creates a CertificateFactory instance capable of creating X.509 certificate instances (X509Certificate - a subclass of Certificate).,"['creation: (certificatefactory, creates, x509certificate)', 'creation: (certificatefactory, creates, certificate)', 'dependency: (x509certificate, a subclass of, certificate)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (certificatefactory, creates, x509certificate)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (certificatefactory, creates, certificate)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (x509certificate, a subclass of, certificate)""]"
You create a CertPath instance by calling the CertificateFactory generateCertPath() method.,,[]
"The Java CertPath class (java.security.cert.CertPath represents a chain of cryptographic identity certificates (Java Certificate objects), where each certificate is the digital signer of the next certificate in the chain.",,[]
The Java CertPath class is typically used to verify an identity certificate along with the certificates of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that signed the certificate.,,[]
Once you have a Java CertPath instance you can obtain the Certificate instances the CertPath consists of by calling the CertPath getCertificates() method.,,[]
The CertPath getType() method returns a string telling what type of certificates (e.g.,,[]
Here is an example of obtaining the CertPath type via getType():,,[]
That is why the Java class is called Cipher and not e.g.,,[]
This Java Cipher tutorial will explain how the Cipher class of the Java Cryptography API works.,,[]
Before you can use a Java Cipher you just create an instance of the Cipher class.,,[]
You create a Cipher instance by calling its getInstance() method with a parameter telling what type of encryption algorithm you want to use.,,[]
There are several overridden versions of both update() and doFinal() which takes different parameters.,"['alternative: (update(), overridden versions, dofinal())', 'similarity: (update(), several overridden versions of both, dofinal())', 'alternative: (update(), takes different parameters, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), overridden versions, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (update(), several overridden versions of both, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), takes different parameters, dofinal())""]"
"If you have to encrypt or decrypt a single block of data, just call the doFinal() with the data to encrypt or decrypt.",,[]
"If you have to encrypt or decrypt multiple blocks of data, e.g.",,[]
"multiple blocks from a large file, you call the update() once for each block of data, and finish with a call to doFinal() with the last data block.","['dependency: (update(), call ... and finish with a call to, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), call ... and finish with a call to, dofinal())""]"
"The reason a call to doFinal() is needed for the last block of data is, that some encryption algorithms need to pad the the data to fit a certain cipher block size (e.g.",,[]
"Hence the calls to update() for intermediate blocks of data, and the call to doFinal() for the last block of data.","['dependency: (update(), for intermediate blocks of data, dofinal())', 'alternative: (update(), for the last block of data, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), for intermediate blocks of data, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), for the last block of data, dofinal())""]"
"When decrypting multiple blocks of data you also call the Cipher update() method for intermediate data blocks, and the doFinal() method for the last block.","['alternative: (update(), for intermediate data blocks, dofinal())', 'dependency: (update(), and, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), for intermediate data blocks, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), and, dofinal())""]"
The Java Cipher class encryption and decryption methods can encrypt or decrypt part of the data stored in a byte array.,,[]
You simply pass an offset and length to the update() and / or doFinal() method.,"['alternative: (update(), or, dofinal())', 'dependency: (update(), and, dofinal())', 'alternative: (dofinal(), or, update())', 'dependency: (dofinal(), and, update())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), or, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), and, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofinal(), or, update())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (dofinal(), and, update())""]"
You can encrypt or decrypt data into an existing byte array by passing the destination byte array as parameter to the update() and / or doFinal() method.,"['alternative: (update(), or, dofinal())', 'dependency: (update(), parameter to, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), or, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), parameter to, dofinal())""]"
If you want to set a different offset for the dest byte array there is a version of update() and doFinal() which takes an offset parameter extra.,"['alternative: (update(), a version of ... which takes an offset parameter extra, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), a version of ... which takes an offset parameter extra, dofinal())""]"
Here is an example of calling the doFinal() method with an offset into the dest array:,,[]
"When you call the doFinal() method on a Cipher instance, the Cipher instance is returned to the state it had just after initialization.","['conversion: (dofinal(), returns to initial state, cipher)', 'modification: (dofinal(), changes state of, cipher)']",[]
Notice the call to update() and then doFinal() for these two blocks of data.,"['dependency: (update(), then dofinal(), dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), then dofinal(), dofinal())""]"
This is done with the doFinal() call with the third data block.,,[]
After this doFinal() call you can encrypt yet another block of data with the same Java Cipher instance.,"['dependency: (dofinal(), can encrypt yet another block of data with the same, cipher)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (dofinal(), can encrypt yet another block of data with the same, cipher)""]"
JCA is structured around some central general purpose classes and interfaces.,,[]
"Thus, you may use a Cipher class to encrypt and decrypt some data, but the concrete cipher implementation (encryption algorithm) depends on the concrete provider used.",,[]
The most commonly used of these classes are covered throughout the rest of this Java Cryptography tutorial.,,[]
The Provider (java.security.Provider) class is a central class in the Java cryptography API.,,[]
"The Cipher class is explained in more detail in the text on the Java Cipher class, but I will give a brief introduction to the Cipher class in the following sections.",,[]
"The Cipher.getInstance(...) method take a String identifying which encryption algorithm to use, as well as a few other configurations of the algorithm.",,[]
"To initialize a Cipher instance to decrypt data you have to use the Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, like this:","['dependency: (cipher, use, cipher.decrypt_mode)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (cipher, use, cipher.decrypt_mode)""]"
You do so by calling the Cipher update() or doFinal() methods.,"['alternative: (update(), or, dofinal())']",[]
The update() method is used if you are encrypting or decrypting part of a bigger chunk of data.,,[]
"The doFinal() method is called when you are encrypting the last part of the big chunk of data, or if the block you pass to doFinal() represents the complete data block to encrypt.",,[]
Here is an example of encrypting some data with the doFinal() method,,[]
To decrypt data you would have passed cipher text (encrypted data) into the doFinal() or doUpdate() method instead.,"['alternative: (dofinal, can be used instead of, doupdate)', 'alternative: (doupdate, can be used instead of, dofinal)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofinal, can be used instead of, doupdate)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (doupdate, can be used instead of, dofinal)""]"
"The example in the previous section about the Cipher class used a very simple, hardcoded key.",,[]
You can use the Java KeyGenerator class to generate more random encryption keys.,,[]
"The resulting SecretKey instance can be passed to the Cipher.init() method, like this:","['dependency: (secretkey, can be passed to, cipher.init)', 'implementation: (secretkey, passed to, cipher.init)', 'example: (secretkey, like this, cipher.init)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (secretkey, can be passed to, cipher.init)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (secretkey, passed to, cipher.init)""]"
To generate an asymmetric key pair you can use the KeyPairGenerator (java.security.KeyPairGenerator).,,[]
The KeyStore class is quite advanced so it is described in more detail in its own Java KeyStore Tutorial.,,[]
You can use the Java MessageDigest (java.security.MessageDigest) to calculate message digests.,,[]
In order to calculate a message digest of some data you call the update() or digest() method.,"['alternative: (update(), or, digest())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), or, digest())""]"
"The update() method can be called multiple times, and the message digest is updated internally.",,[]
"When you have passed all the data you want to include in the message digest, you call digest() and get the resulting message digest data out.",,[]
Here is an example of calling update() several times followed by a digest() call:,"['dependency: (update(), followed by, digest())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), followed by, digest())""]"
You can also call digest() a single time passing all the data to calculate the message digest from.,,[]
The Java Mac class is used to create a MAC from a message.,,[]
"The Mac class is described in more detail in the Java Mac tutorial, but below is a short introduction.",,[]
"You create a Java Mac instance by calling the Mac.getInstance() method, passing as parameter the name of the algorithm to use.",,[]
Once the Mac instance is initialized you can calculate a MAC from data by calling the update() and doFinal() method.,"['dependency: (update(), by calling ... and, dofinal())', 'implementation: (update(), and, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), by calling ... and, dofinal())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (update(), and, dofinal())""]"
"If you have all the data to calculate the MAC for, you can call the doFinal() method immediately.",,[]
"If you only have the access to the data in separate blocks, call update() multiple times with the data, and finish off with a call to doFinal().","['dependency: (update(), finish off with a call to, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), finish off with a call to, dofinal())""]"
You do so by calling the initSign(...) method passing the private key to use to sign the data.,,[]
You do so by calling update() passing the data to sign as parameter.,,[]
You can call the update() method several times with more data to include when creating the signature.,,[]
When all the data has been passed to the update() method you call the sign() method to obtain the digital signature.,"['dependency: (sign(), call after, update())', 'access: (sign(), obtain from, update())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (sign(), call after, update())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (sign(), obtain from, update())""]"
This is done by calling the initVerify(...) method passing as parameter the public key to use to verify the signature.,,[]
"Once initialized into verification mode, you call the update() method with the data the signature is signing, and finish with a call to verify() which returns true or false depending on whether the signature could be verified or not.","['dependency: (verify(), depends on, update())', 'check: (verify(), checks the result of, update())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (verify(), depends on, update())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (verify(), checks the result of, update())""]"
Here is a full example of both creating and verifying a digital signature with the Signature class:,,[]
The Java KeyGenerator class (javax.crypto.KeyGenerator) is used to generate symmetric encryption keys.,,[]
Before you can use the Java KeyGenerator class you must create a KeyGenerator instance.,,[]
You create a KeyGenerator instance by calling the static method getInstance() passing as parameter the name of the encryption algorithm to create a key for.,,[]
Initializing a KeyGenerator instance is done by calling its init() method.,,[]
"The KeyGenerator init() method takes two parameters: The bit size of the keys to generate, and a SecureRandom that is used during key generation.","['dependency: (keygenerator.init(), uses, securerandom)', 'access: (keygenerator.init(), takes, securerandom)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (keygenerator.init(), uses, securerandom)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (keygenerator.init(), takes, securerandom)""]"
Generating a key is done by calling the KeyGenerator generateKey() method.,,[]
You can access the PublicKey of a KeyPair by calling its getPublic() method.,,[]
You can access the PrivateKey of a KeyPair by calling the getPrivate() method.,,[]
The Java KeyPairGenerator class (java.security.KeyPairGenerator) is used to generate asymmetric encryption / decryption key pairs.,,[]
Creating a KeyPairGenerator instance is done by calling the method getInstance() method.,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, creating a ... instance is done by calling the, getinstance())', 'access: (keypairgenerator, calling the method, getinstance())']",[]
The getInstance() method takes the name of the encryption algorithm to generate the key pair for.,,[]
To generate a KeyPair with a KeyPairGenerator you call the generateKeyPair() method.,"['creation: (keypairgenerator, generate, keypair)', 'dependency: (keypair, call generatekeypair() method of, keypairgenerator)', 'access: (keypairgenerator, call, generatekeypair)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (keypairgenerator, generate, keypair)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (keypair, call generatekeypair() method of, keypairgenerator)""]"
This makes the KeyStore class a useful mechanism to handle encryption keys securely.,,[]
You can create a Java KeyStore instance by calling its getInstance() method.,,[]
It is also possible to create other types of KeyStore instance by passing a different parameter to the getInstance() method.,,[]
That is why the KeyStore class assumes that you must read its data in before you can use it.,,[]
Loading the KeyStore data from a file or other storage is done by calling the KeyStore load() method.,,[]
This example loads the KeyStore file located in the keystore.ks file.,,[]
You can get the keys of a Java KeyStore instance via its getEntry() method.,,[]
"Thus, to access a key you must pass the key alias and password to the getEntry() method.",,[]
"If you know that the key entry you want to access is a private key, you can cast the KeyStore.Entry instance to a KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry.","['conversion: (keystore.entry, cast to, keystore.privatekeyentry)', 'access: (keystore.entry, access, keystore.privatekeyentry)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (keystore.entry, cast to, keystore.privatekeyentry)""]"
"After casting to a KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry you can access the private key, certificate and certificate chain via these methods:",,[]
"Sometimes you may want to store a KeyStore to some storage (disk, database etc.)",,[]
"To execute it, open a command line (cmd, console, shell etc.).",,[]
This Keytool -delete command will remove the KeyStore entry with the alias testkey from the KeyStore stored in the file keystore.jks .,,[]
"Once generated, the certificate request should be sent to the CA you want to create a certificate for you (e.g.",,[]
"This command will generate a certificate request for the key stored with alias testkey in the keystore file keystore.jks, and write the certificate request into the file named certreq.certreq .",,[]
The Java Mac (javax.crypto.Mac class can create a Message Authentication Code (MAC) from binary data.,,[]
Before you can use the Java Mac class you must create a Mac instance.,,[]
The String parameter passed to the Mac getInstance() method contains the name of the MAC algorithm to use.,,[]
You initialize the Mac instance by calling its init() method passing as parameter the secret key to be used by the Mac instance.,,[]
To calculate a MAC value you call the Mac update() or doFinal() method.,"['alternative: (update(), or, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (update(), or, dofinal())""]"
"If you only have a single block of data to calculate the MAC for, you can call doFinal() directly, like this:",,[]
"If you have multiple blocks of data to calculate the MAC for, e.g.",,[]
"if you are reading a file block by block, then you must call the update() method with each block, and finish with a call to doFinal().","['dependency: (update(), must finish with, dofinal())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), must finish with, dofinal())""]"
The Java MessageDigest class represents a cryptographic hash function which can calculate a message digest from binary data.,,[]
This tutorial only explains how to use the Java Cryptography API representation of a message digest in the MessageDigest class.,,[]
To create a Java MessageDigest instance you call the static getInstance() method of the MessageDigest class.,"['creation: (messagedigest, create a java messagedigest instance you call the static getinstance() method of the, messagedigest)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (messagedigest, create a java messagedigest instance you call the static getinstance() method of the, messagedigest)""]"
The text parameter passed to the getInstance() method is the name of the concrete message digest algorithm to use.,,[]
"If you have a single block of data to calculate a message digest from, use the digest() method.",,[]
"If you have multiple blocks of data to include in the same message digest, call the update() method and finish off with a call to digest().","['dependency: (update(), finish off with a call to, digest())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (update(), finish off with a call to, digest())""]"
The Java Signature class (java.security.Signature) can create a digital signature for binary data.,,[]
Before you can use the Java Signature class you must create a Signature instance.,,[]
You create a Signature instance by calling the static getInstance() method.,,[]
The String passed as parameter to the getInstance() method is the name of the digital signature algorithm to use.,,[]
"You create a digital signature by calling the update() method one or more times, finishing with a call to sign().","['dependency: (sign(), finishing with a call to, update())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (sign(), finishing with a call to, update())""]"

Hopefully that will help you get an overview of Java's date and time classes.,,[]
I also hope it may clear up some of the confusion Sun has created with Java's many date and time classes.,"['replacement: (java.util.date, has created confusion with, java.time.*)', 'alternative: (java.util.date, many date and time classes alternative to, java.time.*)']",[]

The new Java date time API is located in the Java package java.time which is part of the standard Java 8 class library.,,[]
You will see this new date and time representation in many of the classes in the new Java date time API.,,[]
The java.time package also contains a set of subpackages which contain more utilities etc.,,[]
"For instance the java.time.chrono contains classes to work with Japanese, Thai, Taiwanese and Islamic calendars.",,[]
The java.time.format package contains classes used to parse and format dates from and to strings.,,[]
The core of the Java 8 date time API consists of the following classes:,"['containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.localdate)', 'containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.localtime)', 'containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.localdatetime)', 'containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.instant)', 'containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.duration)', 'containment: (java.time, consists of, java.time.period)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.localdate)"", ""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.localtime)"", ""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.localdatetime)"", ""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.instant)"", ""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.duration)"", ""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, consists of, java.time.period)""]"
Java 7 has the following date and time classes and methods.,,[]
"Each of these classes are also explained in their own pages, later.",,[]
If you need to do simple timing the System.currentTimeMillis() method will do just fine.,,[]
"If you just need an object to hold a date, for instance as a property in a simple domain model object, you can use the java.util.Date class.",,[]
"If you need to read and write the date and time to a database, use the java.sql.Date and java.sql.Timestamp classes.","['alternative: (java.sql.date, use ... instead of ..., java.sql.timestamp)', 'alternative: (java.sql.timestamp, use ... instead of ..., java.sql.date)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.date, use ... instead of ..., java.sql.timestamp)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.timestamp, use ... instead of ..., java.sql.date)""]"

The Java DateTimeFormatter class is used to parse and format dates represented with the classes in the Java 8 date time API.,,[]
The DateTimeFormatter is located in the java.time.format package so the fully qualified class name is java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.,"['containment: (java.time.format.datetimeformatter, is located in, java.time.format)', 'dependency: (java.time.format.datetimeformatter, fully qualified class name is, java.time.format)']",[]
The DateTimeFormatter class contains a set of predefined (constant) instances which can parse and format dates from standard date formats.,,[]
You can read about them in the JavaDoc for the DateTimeFormatter class.,,[]
Once you have an instance of a DateTimeFormatter you can format a date using its format() method.,,[]
A Duration object (java.time.Duration) represents a period of time between two Instant objects.,"['difference: (java.time.duration, represents a period of time between two, java.time.instant)', 'reference: (java.time.duration, between two, java.time.instant)']","[""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (java.time.duration, between two, java.time.instant)""]"
The Duration class was added to the Java date time API from Java 8.,,[]
Creating a Duration object is done using one of the Duration class factory methods.,,[]
Here is an example of how to create a Duration object using the between() method:,,[]
This is somewhat different from what we are used to with System.getCurrentTimeMillis() where a moment in time (or a period between two moments) is represented as a number of milliseconds.,,[]
The toNanos() is different from the getNano() in that the getNano() only returns the part of the Duration which is less than one second.,"['difference: (tonanos(), is different from, getnano())', 'difference: (getnano(), only returns the part of the duration which is less than one second, tonanos())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (tonanos(), is different from, getnano())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (getnano(), only returns the part of the duration which is less than one second, tonanos())""]"
The toNanos() method returns the full time interval converted to nanoseconds.,,[]
You might be asking yourself if there is not a toSeconds() method.,,[]
You can obtain the seconds part of the Duration using the getSeconds() method as explained earlier.,,[]
The Duration class contains a set of methods you can use to perform calculations based on a Duration object.,,[]
The Instant class in the Java date time API (java.time.Instant) represents a specific moment on the time line.,,[]
"Time is measured using 86.400 seconds per day, moving forward from the origin.",,[]
You create an Instant instance using one of the Instant class factory methods.,"['creation: (instant, create, instant())']",[]
"For instance, to create an Instant which represents this exact moment of now, call Instant.now(), like this:","['creation: (instant, create, instant)', 'access: (instant, call, instant.now)', 'example: (instant.now, call instant.now() to create an instant which represents this exact moment of now, instant)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (instant, create, instant)"", ""('method', 'example', 'class'): (instant.now, call instant.now() to create an instant which represents this exact moment of now, instant)""]"
The Instant class also has several methods which can be used to make calculations relative to an Instant.,,[]
The LocalDate class in the Java 8 date time API represents a local date which is a date without time zone information.,,[]
"The LocalDate Java class is located in the java.time package, so its fully qualified class name is java.time.LocalDate.","['containment: (java.time, located in, java.time.localdate)', 'dependency: (java.time.localdate, is located in, java.time)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.time, located in, java.time.localdate)""]"
Here is an example of creating a LocalDate using the now() method:,,[]
"The LocalDate's of() method creates a LocalDate instance representing a specific day of a specific month of a specific year, but without time zone information.","['creation: (localdate.of(), creates, localdate)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (localdate.of(), creates, localdate)""]"
Notice how the getMonth() and getDayOfWeek() methods return an enum instead of an int.,"['similarity: (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())', 'alternative: (getmonth(), instead of, getdayofweek())', 'difference: (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (getmonth(), instead of, getdayofweek())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (getmonth(), return an enum instead of an int, getdayofweek())""]"
From these enums you can obtain their information as int values by calling their getValue() methods.,,[]
You can perform a set of simple date calculations with the LocalDate class using one or more of the following methods:,,[]
The LocalDateTime class in the Java 8 date time API (java.time.LocalDateTime) represents a local date and time without any time zone information.,,[]
You could view the LocalDateTime as a combination of the LocalDate and LocalTime classes of the Java 8 date time API.,"['containment: (localdatetime, a combination of, localdate)', 'containment: (localdatetime, a combination of, localtime)', 'dependency: (localdatetime, relies on, localdate)', 'dependency: (localdatetime, relies on, localtime)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (localdatetime, a combination of, localdate)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (localdatetime, a combination of, localtime)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (localdatetime, relies on, localdate)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (localdatetime, relies on, localtime)""]"
Here is an example that shows how to create a LocalDateTime object via the now() method:,"['creation: (now(), creates, localdatetime)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (now(), creates, localdatetime)""]"
"The parameters to the of() method are year, month, day (of month), hours, minutes, seconds and nanoseconds.",,[]
Via the methods that return an enum you can get an int representation of the enum by calling the getValue() of the enum .,,[]
The LocalTime class in the Java 8 date time API represents a specific time of day without any time zone information.,,[]
"The LocalTime class is immutable, so all calculations on LocalTime objects return a new LocalTime instance.",,[]
"There are also other versions of the of() method that only takes hours and minutes, or hours, minutes and seconds as parameters.",,[]
The LocalTime class contains a set of methods that enable you to perform local time calculations.,,[]
The static method System.currentTimeMillis() returns the time since January 1st 1970 in milliseconds.,,[]
"The returned long value can be used to initialize java.util.Date, java.sql.Date, java.sql.Timestamp and java.util.GregorianCalendar objects.","['alternative: (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.date)', 'alternative: (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.timestamp)', 'alternative: (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)', 'alternative: (java.sql.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.timestamp)', 'alternative: (java.sql.date, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)', 'alternative: (java.sql.timestamp, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.date)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.timestamp)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.date, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.date, can be used to initialize, java.sql.timestamp)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.date, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.timestamp, can be used to initialize, java.util.gregoriancalendar)""]"
The granularity of the System.currentTimeMillis() method is larger than 1 millisecond.,,[]
Measuring time in Java is easiest to do with the System.currentTimeMillis() method.,,[]
The variable totalTime will now contain the total time it took to execute the callOperationToTime() method.,,[]
"Because System.currentTimeMillis() does not return the time that accurately, it is a good idea to execute the operation to measure more than once.",,[]
"Another good reason to repeat the operation to measure a lot of times is to allow the Java virtual machine to load the classes containing the code, JIT-compile it, and perhaps even optimize it.",,[]
"The calculations listed earlier in this text are rather trivial yet tedious to do, and could be encapsulated in a Timer class.",,[]
The ZonedDateTime class in the Java 8 date time API represents a date and time with time zone information.,,[]
The first way is to call the now() method of the ZonedDateTime class.,,[]
Here is an example of creating a ZonedDateTime object using the now() method:,"['creation: (now(), creates, zoneddatetime)', 'example: (now(), exemplifies creation of, zoneddatetime)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (now(), creates, zoneddatetime)"", ""('method', 'example', 'class'): (now(), exemplifies creation of, zoneddatetime)""]"
Another way to create a ZonedDateTime object is to use the of() method which can create a ZonedDateTime object from a concrete date and time.,"['creation: (zoneddatetime, create, of())']",[]
Here is an example of creating a ZonedDateTime object using the of() method:,,[]
From the enums you can return an int representation of their value using their getValue() methods.,,[]
The ZonedDateTime class contains a set of methods used for date time calculations.,,[]
The time zones are represented by the ZoneId class as shown in the earlier example.,,[]
The parameter passed to the of() method is the ID of the time zone to create a ZoneId for.,"['creation: (of(), creates a zoneid for, zoneid)', 'access: (of(), parameter passed to, zoneid)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (of(), creates a zoneid for, zoneid)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (of(), parameter passed to, zoneid)""]"
"You can find the UTC offset for the desired time zone and create an ID matching it by combining ""UTC"" with the offset (e.g.",,[]
"If you need to set a date on a java.sql.PreparedStatement or get a date from a java.sql.ResultSet, you will interact with java.sql.Date.","['access: (java.sql.preparedstatement, get a date from, java.sql.resultset)', 'transfer: (java.sql.preparedstatement, set a date on, java.sql.date)', 'transfer: (java.sql.resultset, get a date from, java.sql.date)']","[""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (java.sql.preparedstatement, set a date on, java.sql.date)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (java.sql.resultset, get a date from, java.sql.date)""]"

"The biggest difference between java.sql.Date and java.util.Date is that the java.sql.Date only keeps the date, not the time, of the date it represents.","['difference: (java.util.date, keeps the time, java.sql.date)']",[]
"So, for instance, if you create a java.sql.Date using the date and time 2009-12-24 23:20, then the time (23:20) would be cut off.",,[]
"If you need to keep the time, use a java.sql.Timestamp instead.",,[]

One difference in the java.sql.Timestamp from its superclass java.util.Date is its ability to hold the nanoseconds of a date too.,"['difference: (java.sql.timestamp, one difference is its ability to hold the nanoseconds of a date too, java.util.date)', 'dependency: (java.sql.timestamp, superclass, java.util.date)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.sql.timestamp, superclass, java.util.date)""]"

Java's java.util.Calendar class is used to do date and time arithmetic.,,[]
"Whenever you have something slightly more advanced than just representing a date and time, this is the class to use.",,[]
"Java only comes with a Gregorian calendar implementation, the java.util.GregorianCalendar class.",,[]
"The Calendar class has a couple of methods you can use to access the year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, milliseconds and time zone of a given date.",,[]
The Calendar class has a corresponding set() method so you can set these fields too.,"['reference: (calendar, has a corresponding, set())']",[]
"The add() method is really handy when doing date arithmetics like adding or subtracting years, months, days, hours etc.",,[]
"To subtract from the fields call the add() method with negative values, like this:",,[]
There are a few minor traps in the Calendar class that you should be aware of to avoid unnecessary headaches.,,[]
The MONTH field of the Calendar class does not go from 1 to 12 like they do when we write dates otherwise.,"['difference: (calendar, does not go from 1 to 12, month)', 'access: (calendar, the month field of, month)']",[]
"That means that 1 = sunday, 2 = monday, ..., 7 = saturday.",,[]
If you need to do heavy or complex date and time calculations it is a good idea to read the class documentation for java.util.Calendar in the official JavaDoc's.,,[]
The class documentation contains more detail about the specific behaviour of the class.,,[]
Today most of the methods in the class are deprecated in favor of the java.util.Calendar class.,,[]
You can still use the java.util.Date class to represent a date though.,,[]
"You can access the date and time contained in a java.util.Date instance using the getTime() method, like this:","['access: (java.util.date, access the date and time contained in, gettime())', 'access: (java.util.date, access ... using, gettime())']",[]
"You can also create a java.util.Date from a time in milliseconds, like this:",,[]
You can compare java.util.Date instance because the class implements the java.lang.Comparable interface.,"['implementation: (java.util.date, implements, java.lang.comparable)', 'dependency: (java.util.date, relies on, java.lang.comparable)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (java.util.date, implements, java.lang.comparable)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (java.util.date, relies on, java.lang.comparable)""]"
"The comparison follows the rules for the Comparable interface, meaning the compareTo() method returns:",,[]
"The Java TimeZone class is a class that represents time zones, and is helpful when doing calendar arithmetics across time zones.",,[]
The java.util.TimeZone class is used in conjunction with the java.util.Calendar class.,"['dependency: (java.util.timezone, used in conjunction with, java.util.calendar)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.timezone, used in conjunction with, java.util.calendar)""]"
Note: In the Java 8 date time API the time zones are represented by the java.time.ZoneId class.,,[]
But you only need to use the ZoneId class if you are using the Java 8 date time classes (like the ZonedDateTime class).,"['dependency: (zoneddatetime, need to use, zoneid)', 'example: (zoneddatetime, like, zoneid)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (zoneddatetime, need to use, zoneid)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (zoneddatetime, like, zoneid)""]"
If you use a Calendar (from the Java 7 and earlier date time API) you can still use the java.util.TimeZone class.,"['alternative: (java.util.calendar, can still use, java.util.timezone)', 'dependency: (java.util.calendar, use, java.util.timezone)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.calendar, can still use, java.util.timezone)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.calendar, use, java.util.timezone)""]"
The first method (TimeZone.getDefault()) returns the default time zone for the system (computer) this program is running on.,,[]
"The second method (TimeZone.getTimeZone(""Europe/Copenhagen"")) returns the TimeZone corresponding to the given time zone ID (in this example ""Europe/Copenhagen"").","['access: (timezone.gettimezone, returns, timezone)', 'example: (timezone.gettimezone, ""europe/copenhagen"", timezone)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (timezone.gettimezone, returns, timezone)"", '(\'method\', \'example\', \'class\'): (timezone.gettimezone, ""europe/copenhagen"", timezone)']"
"The getOffset() method returns the offset in milliseconds for the given time zone to UTC, at the given time.",,[]
The Calendar class is capable of converting the date and time between time zones.,,[]
"Here is a list of the available time zone ids in the TimeZone class, printed as returned by TimeZone.getAvailableIDs().","['access: (timezone, getavailableids(), timezone)', 'reference: (timezone.getavailableids(), returned by, timezone)']",[]
"It is possible to both parse dates from strings, and format dates to strings, using Java's java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.",,[]
It is also possible to parse and format dates using the newer Java DateTimeFormatter which is able to parse and format dates from and to the newer date time classes added in Java 8.,,[]
"Even though both classes for parsing and formatting dates are covered in more detail in their own texts, I will show you a few examples of how to use them below.",,[]
Here is an example of how to format and parse a date using the SimpleDateFormat class.,,[]
The string passed as parameter to the SimpleDateFormat class is a pattern that tells how the instance is to parse and format dates.,,[]
"For a full list, see the official JavaDoc for the SimpleDateFormat class.",,[]
Another way to format dates is to use the DateTimeFormatter which works with the newer date time classes added in Java 8.,,[]
In the example above we use the DateTimeFormatter.BASIC_ISO_DATE instance which is configured to parse and format dates using the ISO date time format.,,[]
"Exceptions are regular Java classes that extends java.lang.Exception, or any of the other built-in exception classes.",,[]
"If a method declares that it throws an exception A, then it is also legal to throw subclasses of A.",,[]
"In the example above the ""System.out.println(result);"" statement will not get executed if an exception is thrown fromt the divide method.",,[]
"In the example above the ""System.out.println(""Division attempt done"");"" statement will always get executed.",,[]
Here is how the callDivide() method would look in that case.,,[]
"Thus the ""System.out.println(result);"" method will not get executed if an exception is thrown from the divide method.",,[]
"If the reader.read() method call throws an IOException, the following System.out.println((char) i ); is not executed.","['check: (reader.read(), ioexception check before execution, system.out.println())', 'dependency: (system.out.println(), depends on the success of, reader.read())']","[""('method', 'check', 'method'): (reader.read(), ioexception check before execution, system.out.println())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (system.out.println(), depends on the success of, reader.read())""]"

Instead the program skips directly to the catch(IOException e){ ... } catch clause.,,[]
"If an exception is thrown from the reader.read() method then program execution is halted, and the exception is passed up the call stack to the method that called openFile().","['dependency: (openfile(), called by, reader.read())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (openfile(), called by, reader.read())""]"
"If the calling method also just throws the method on, the calling method is also interrupted at the openFile() method call, and the exception passed on up the call stack.",,[]
That is why the previous example had the reader.close() method call in the finally block wrapped in a try-catch block:,,[]
"That way the System.out.println(""--- File End ---""); method call will always be executed.",,[]
Notice how the two exception class names in the first catch block are separated by the pipe character |.,,[]
The pipe character between exception class names is how you declare multiple exceptions to be caught by the same catch clause.,,[]
If storeDataFromUrl() wants to call readDataFromUrl() it has only two choices.,"['dependency: (storedatafromurl(), wants to call, readdatafromurl())', 'access: (storedatafromurl(), call, readdatafromurl())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (storedatafromurl(), wants to call, readdatafromurl())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (storedatafromurl(), call, readdatafromurl())""]"
Notice how the readDataFromUrl() method no longer declares that it throws BadUrlException.,,[]
"The storeDataFromUrl() method can still choose to catch the exception but it no longer has to, and it no longer has to declare that it propagates the exception.",,[]
As you can see the readNumberFromUrl() needs to declare throwing both the BadUrlException and the BadNumberException that are thrown from the readDataFromUrl() and converData() methods.,"['dependency: (readnumberfromurl(), needs to declare throwing both the badurlexception and the badnumberexception that are thrown from, readdatafromurl())', 'dependency: (readnumberfromurl(), needs to declare throwing both the badurlexception and the badnumberexception that are thrown from, converdata())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (readnumberfromurl(), needs to declare throwing both the badurlexception and the badnumberexception that are thrown from, readdatafromurl())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (readnumberfromurl(), needs to declare throwing both the badurlexception and the badnumberexception that are thrown from, converdata())""]"
Imagine how many exceptions would need to be declared at the top level methods of an application with thousands of classes.,,[]
As you can see the readNumberFromUrl() method now only declares throwing ApplicationException.,,[]
Notice how the readNumberFromUrl() method does not declare throwing the ApplicationException even if it throws it.,,[]
All exceptions thrown in the application must be a subclass of the base exception.,,[]
As you know a method throwing Exception may also throw any subclass of Exception.,,[]
They are subclasses of the ApplicationException so they will get propagated up the call stack.,,[]
Argument 5 (Pro Unchecked Exceptions) Checked exceptions declared on methods become part of a the class or interface contract.,,[]
The only requirement is that the new exceptions thrown are subclasses of the base exception.,,[]

When method1() is called from method3() the error identification will look like this:,"['dependency: (method3, is called from, method1)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (method3, is called from, method1)""]"

Generics is not restricted to the predefined classes in the Java API's.,,[]
The <T> is a type token that signals that this class can have a type set when instantiated.,,[]
Notice how it is not necessary to cast the object returned from the factory.createInstance() method.,,[]
Notice how we can call the addAndReturn() method using both String's and Integer's and their corresponding collections.,,[]
"Java Generic's wildcards is a mechanism in Java Generics aimed at making it possible to cast a collection of a certain class, e.g A, to a collection of a subclass or superclass of A.",,[]
"In listA you can insert objects that are either instances of A, or subclasses of A (B and C).",,[]
When you then try to take objects out of listB you could risk to get non-B objects out (e.g.,,[]
Thus you could insert non-B objects into a list declared to hold B (or B subclass) instances.,,[]
"Imagine you have a method that processes the elements of a List, e.g.",,[]

Here are a few examples of calls to the getInstance() method:,,[]
As you can see the return type changes depending on what class object you pass in as parameter to the method.,,[]
It is possible to use your own collection type classes with the new for-loop.,,[]
And here is the corresponding implementation skeleton of the MyIterator class:,,[]
Generics add a way to specify concrete types to general purpose classes and methods that operated on Object before.,,[]

"When you just write a diamond operator as generic type, the Java compiler will assume that the class instantiated is to have the same type as the variable it is assigned to.",,[]
This for-loop is shorter than original while-loop where you would iterate the collections Iterator and call Iterator.next() to obtain the next instance.,,[]

You create a DateFormat using the getDateInstance() and getTimeInstance() method of the DateFormat class.,"['access: (dateformat, getdateinstance(), dateformat)', 'access: (dateformat, gettimeinstance(), dateformat)']",[]
The date format parameter can be chosen among the following constants in the DateFormat class:,,[]
"In order to format only time and not the date itself, you need a time instance of the DateFormat class.",,[]
The java.text.DecimalFormat class is used to format numbers using a formatting pattern you specify yourself.,,[]
This text explains how to use the DecimalFormat class to format different types of numbers.,,[]
You can change this pattern later using the applyPattern() or applyLocalizedPattern() method.,"['alternative: (applypattern(), or, applylocalizedpattern())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (applypattern(), or, applylocalizedpattern())""]"
The applyPattern() method simply applies a new pattern to the DecimalFormat instance as if it were created with that pattern.,"['modification: (applypattern(), applies a new pattern to, decimalformat)']",[]
The applyLocalizedPattern() does the same as applyPattern() except it interpretes the characters in the pattern according to the Locale the DecimalFormat was created with.,"['alternative: (applylocalizedpattern(), does the same as, applypattern())', 'difference: (applylocalizedpattern(), interpretes the characters in the pattern according to the locale the decimalformat was created with, applypattern())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (applylocalizedpattern(), does the same as, applypattern())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (applylocalizedpattern(), interpretes the characters in the pattern according to the locale the decimalformat was created with, applypattern())""]"
You format a number using the format() method of the DecimalFormat instance.,,[]
"For a full explanation of what these methods do, see the JavaDoc for the DecimalFormatSymbols class.",,[]
The DecimalFormat class has a method called setGroupingSize() which sets how many digits of the integer part to group.,"['reference: (decimalformat, has a method called, setgroupingsize())', 'containment: (decimalformat, has a method, setgroupingsize())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (decimalformat, has a method, setgroupingsize())""]"

"The Character.isLetterOrDigit() checks according to the unicode characters if a character is a letter or digit - and thus not just in the english language, but also in other languages.",,[]
Java has some methods in the java.lang.Character class that are useful in internationalization of Java applications.,,[]
"To safely check if a character is a letter, number or space character you need to use the methods in java.lang.Character to do so.",,[]
The Character class also has a getType() method which returns the type of a certain character.,,[]
The returned type is an int which matches a set of predefined constants in the Character class.,,[]
Look in the JavaDoc for the Character class for more constants.,,[]
The Character class also has a method that enables you to determine if the value of a given int defines a character in unicode.,,[]
"Thus, simply using the String.compareTo() method may not work for all languages.",,[]
"To sort a collection of strings according to the rules of a certain Locale, you use a java.text.Collator instance created for that specific Locale.",,[]
To compare two strings using the Collator instance you call the compare() method.,,[]
The compare() method returns an int with the same meaning as the String.compareTo() method:,"['similarity: (compare(), same meaning as, string.compareto())', 'reference: (compare(), returns an int with the same meaning as, string.compareto())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (compare(), same meaning as, string.compareto())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (compare(), returns an int with the same meaning as, string.compareto())""]"
A 0 means that the two strings have the same order - e.g.,,[]
There are more rules you can use with the RuleBasedCollator class.,,[]
You normalize a string using the static normalize() method of the java.text.Normalizer class.,"['access: (java.text.normalizer, normalize() method of, java.text.normalizer)']",[]
The first parameter to the normalize() method is the text to normalize.,,[]
You can use the String class to convert a byte array to a String instance.,,[]
You can convert the text of a String to another format using the getBytes() method.,,[]

This is done using the second constructor paramter in the InputStreamReader class.,,[]
"Input is everything that your application receives from its users, either directly through the user interface, sent to it via service calls (e.g.",,[]

Java has a set of built-in classes that can help you handle internationalization of your application.,,[]
Each of these classes are covered in more detail in later texts in this trail.,,[]
In Java you can convert between time zones using the java.util.Calendar class.,,[]
"Please not, that the Calendar.getTimeInMillis() always returns the time in UTC, regardless of the time zone set on the Calendar instance.",,[]

See the JavaDoc for the Locale class for more detail about extensions.,,[]
Creating a java.util.Locale instance can be done in four different ways:,,[]
The java.util.Locale class contains a set of constants that represent the most commonly used languages in the world.,,[]
You can also create a java.util.Locale instance by using one of its constructors.,,[]
From Java 7 you can use the Locale.Builder class to build a Locale instance.,"['creation: (locale.builder, can use ... to build a, locale)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (locale.builder, can use ... to build a, locale)""]"

"English or Danish), so I may want to temporarily change language to e.g.",,[]
The java.text.NumberFormat class is used to format numbers according to a specific Locale.,,[]
Formatting a number using a NumberFormatter is done using the format() method.,,[]
"Notice that numbers like 100.00 might be formatted without the decimals, as 100.",,[]

"The Java ResourceBundle class, java.util.ResourceBundle, is used to store texts and components that are locale sensitive.",,[]
"A user's locale is represented by the Java Locale class, by the way.",,[]
This text takes a closer look at the ResourceBundle class and its subclasses.,,[]
The PropertyResourceBundle class stores localized texts in standard Java property files.,,[]
Then you pass that Locale instance to the ResourceBundle.getBundle() method along with the name of the resource bundle to load.,"['access: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), uses, locale)', 'dependency: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), depends on, locale)', 'transfer: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), receives, locale)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (resourcebundle.getbundle(), uses, locale)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (resourcebundle.getbundle(), depends on, locale)"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (resourcebundle.getbundle(), receives, locale)""]"
Finally you can access the localized values in the ResourceBundle via its different getString() and getObject() etc.,"['alternative: (getstring(), alternative, getobject())', 'access: (resourcebundle, access, getstring())', 'access: (resourcebundle, access, getobject())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (getstring(), alternative, getobject())""]"

For this example to work you should put a standard Java property file named MyBundle.properties in a Java package named i18n.,,[]
"Make sure this property file is available on your class path when you run the above code, meaning the property file should be located among the classes of your application, and in the i18n package.",,[]
The name of a resource bundle is like a class name.,,[]
"Thus, i18n.MyBundle means a property file named MyBundle.properties in the package (directory) i18n.",,[]
"In case no property file is available for the language (Locale) passed to the ResourceBundle.getBundle() method, and the system has no default Locale set (e.g.","['dependency: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), uses, locale)', 'access: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), accesses, locale)', 'check: (resourcebundle.getbundle(), checks, locale)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (resourcebundle.getbundle(), uses, locale)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (resourcebundle.getbundle(), accesses, locale)""]"
You can also use a set of classes to contain your resources.,,[]

Some of the classes in the Java IO API are designed to help you parse input.,,[]
The purpose was rather to give you above quick list of classes related to parsing of input data.,,[]
If you have to parse data you will often end up writing your own classes that use some of the classes in this list.,,[]
The Java LineNumberReader class (java.io.LineNumberReader is a BufferedReader that keeps track of line numbers of the read characters.,"['dependency: (java.io.linenumberreader, is a, bufferedreader)', 'reference: (java.io.linenumberreader, keeps track of line numbers of the read characters, bufferedreader)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.io.linenumberreader, is a, bufferedreader)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (java.io.linenumberreader, keeps track of line numbers of the read characters, bufferedreader)""]"

In this text I will try to give you an overview of the classes in the Java IO (java.io) package.,,[]
"More specifically, I will try to group the classes after their purpose.",,[]

"The reason is, that all of these subclasses are addressing various different purposes.",,[]
These purposes are nice to know about when reading through the Java IO classes.,,[]
They make it somewhat easier to understand what the classes are targeting.,,[]

The Java PrintWriter class (java.io.PrintWriter) enables you to write formatted data to an underlying Writer.,,[]
The PrintWriter class has all the same methods as the PrintStream except for the methods to write raw bytes.,"['difference: (printwriter, has all the same methods as except for the methods to write raw bytes, printstream)', 'similarity: (printwriter, has all the same methods as, printstream)']",[]

The Java Reader (java.io.Reader) and Java Writer class (java.io.Writer) in Java IO work much like the InputStream and OutputStream with the exception that Reader and Writer are character based.,"['similarity: (java.io.reader, work much like, java.io.writer)', 'difference: (java.io.reader, character based, java.io.writer)', 'alternative: (java.io.reader, exception that, java.io.writer)']","[""('class', 'similarity', 'class'): (java.io.reader, work much like, java.io.writer)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.io.reader, exception that, java.io.writer)""]"
The Java Reader is the base class of all Reader's in the Java IO API.,,[]
The Java Writer class is the base class of all Writers in the Java IO API.,,[]
Before you can use the SequenceInputStream you must import it in your Java class.,,[]
"This import statement should be at the top of your Java class, right under the package declaration.",,[]
"The FileInputStream extends the InputStream class, so they can be used with the SequenceInputStream.",,[]
"When there is no more data to read from the second InputStream, the SequenceInputStream read() method will return -1, just like any other InputStream does.",,[]
The Java Serializable interface (java.io.Serializable is a marker interface your classes must implement if they are to be serialized and deserialized.,,[]
"Therefore, a class implementing Serializable does not have to implement any specific methods.",,[]
Implementing Serializable thus just tells the Java serialization classes that this class is intended for object serialization.,,[]
Here is an example of a class that implements the Java Serializable interface:,,[]
"As you can see, the Person class implements the Serializable interface, but does not actually implement any methods.",,[]
"In addition to implementing the Serializable interface, a class intended for serialization should also contain a private static final long variable named serialVersionUID.",,[]
"Here is the Person class from before, with a serialVersionUID variable added:",,[]
"The serialVersionUID variable is used by Java's object serialization API to determine if a deserialized object was serialized (written) with the same version of the class, as it is now attempting to deserialize it into.",,[]
Now the serialized Person object may not correspond to the new version of the Person class.,,[]
To detect such problems a class implementing Serializable should contain a serialVersionUID field.,,[]
"If you make big changes to the class, you should also change its serialVersionUID value.",,[]
"These other object serialization mechanisms typically do not require your Java classes to implement Serializable, by the way.",,[]
"They are typically using Java Reflection to inspect your class, so implementing the Serializable interface would be superflous - it would not add any useful information.",,[]
The class java.io.InputStream is the base class for all Java IO input streams.,,[]
"If you are writing a component that needs to read input from a stream, try to make our component depend on an InputStream, rather than any of it's subclasses (e.g.",,[]
"Doing so makes your code able to work with all types of input streams, instead of only the concrete subclass.",,[]
Otherwise your code will not be able to call the unread() method on the PushbackInputStream.,,[]
You typically read data from an InputStream by calling the read() method.,,[]
The read() method returns a int containing the byte value of the byte read.,,[]
"If there is no more data to be read, the read() method typically returns -1;",,[]
The class java.io.OutputStream is the base class of all Java IO output streams.,,[]
"If you are writing a component that needs to write output to a stream, try to make sure that component depends on an OutputStream and not one of its subclasses.",,[]
You can even write your own stream classes to wrap the standard stream classes that comes with Java.,,[]
The Java StringReader class enables you to turn an ordinary String into a Reader.,,[]
Closing a Java StringReader can be done using the close() method like this:,,[]
Notice that there is no explicit close() call on the StringReader.,,[]
The Java StringWriter class (java.io.StringWriter) enables you to obtain the characters written to a Writer as a String.,,[]
Third the characters written to the StringWriter are obtained via the two methods toString() and getBuffer().,,[]
The method toString() returns the characters written to the StringWriter as a String.,,[]
The method getBuffer() returns the StringBuffer used by the StringWriter to build the string from the written characters.,,[]
Notice how there is no longer any explicit close() method call to the StringWriter instance.,,[]
The Java IO API is located in the Java IO package (java.io).,,[]
If you look at the Java IO classes in the java.io package the vast amount of choices can be rather confusing.,,[]
"The purpose of this tutorial is to try to give you an overview of how all these classes are grouped, and the purpose behind them, so you don't have to wonder whether you chose the right class, or whether a class already exists for your purpose.",,[]
"That tutorial gives you a quick overview of the central concepts in the Java IO API, and an overview of all the central classes in the Java IO API.",,[]
The java.io package doesn't actually address all types of input and output.,,[]
"Those types of input are covered elsewhere, for instance by the JFC classes in the Swing project, or the Servlet and HTTP packages in the Java Enterprise Edition.",,[]
"However, the Java IO package does not contain classes to open network sockets which are necessary for network communication.",,[]
"Once you have opened a socket (network connection) though, you read and write data to and from it via Java IO's InputStream and OutputStream classes.",,[]
"It contains classes that does much of the same as the Java IO and Java Networking APIs, but Java NIO can work in non-blocking mode.",,[]
The tutorial trail called Java How To's and Utilities also contain a few Java IO utilities - e.g.,,[]
"Here is a table listing most (if not all) Java IO classes divided by input, output, being byte based or character based, and any more specific purpose they may be addressing, like buffering, parsing etc.",,[]
"The Java OutputStream class, java.io.OutputStream, is the base class of all output streams in the Java IO API.",,[]
Subclasses of OutputStream include the Java BufferedOutputStream and the Java FileOutputStream among others.,,[]
Here are some of the well-known subclasses of the Java OutputStream class:,,[]
The write() method of an OutputStream takes an int which contains the byte value of the byte to write.,,[]
This OutputStream write() example first creates a FileOutputStream to which the data will be written.,,[]
The condition to exit the while loop is the return value of the method hasMoreData().,,[]
"The implementation of hasMoreData() is not shown, but imagine that it returns true if there is more data to write, and false if not.",,[]
"Inside the while loop the example calls the method getMoreData() to get the next data to write to the OutputStream, and then writes that data to the OutputStream.",,[]
The Java OutputStream's flush() method flushes all data written to the OutputStream to the underlying data destination.,,[]
"By calling flush() you can assure that any buffered data will be flushed (written) to disk (or network, or whatever else the destination of your OutputStream has).",,[]
Here is an example of flushing data written to a Java OutputStream by calling its flush() method:,,[]
"What matters is, that once the while loop ends, and you are done writing data to the OutputStream, its close() method is called, which closes the OutputStream .",,[]
"Once the try block is exited, the close() method of the OutputStream is called automatically, because the OutputStream was declared inside the parentheses of the try block.",,[]
You can convert a OutputStream to a character based Writer using the Java OutputStreamWriter class.,,[]
"The Java OutputStreamWriter class, java.io.OutputStreamWriter, is intended to wrap an Java OutputStream and thereby turning the byte based output stream into a character based Writer.",,[]
"The Java OutputStreamWriter is useful if you need to write characters to a file, encoded as e.g.",,[]
The Java OutputStreamWriter is a subclass of the Java Writer class.,,[]
"The Java OutputStreamWriter also has alternative constructors that allow you to specify the character set (ISO-Latin1, UTF-8, UTF-16 etc.)",,[]
The Java OutputStreamWriter's flush() method flushes all data written to the OutputStreamWriter to the underlying data destination.,,[]
"By calling flush() you can assure that any buffered data will be flushed (written) to disk (or network, or whatever else the destination of your OutputStreamWriter has).",,[]
Here is an example of flushing data written to a Java OutputStreamWriter by calling its flush() method:,,[]

Here is a thing the JavaDoc forgets to mention: The read() method increments the file pointer to point to the next byte in the file after the byte just read!,,[]
This means that you can continue to call read() without having to manually move the file pointer.,,[]
This example reads a sequence of bytes into the dest byte array passed as parameter to the read() method.,,[]
The read() method will start reading in the file from the current file position of the RandomAccessFile.,,[]
"The read() method will start writing data into the byte array starting from the array position provided by the offset parameter, and at most the number of bytes provided by the length parameter.",,[]
You can write a single byte to a RandomAccessFile using its write() method which takes an int as parameter.,"['transfer: (write(), write a single byte to, randomaccessfile)', 'access: (write(), takes an int as parameter, randomaccessfile)', 'dependency: (write(), using, randomaccessfile)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (write(), write a single byte to, randomaccessfile)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (write(), takes an int as parameter, randomaccessfile)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (write(), using, randomaccessfile)""]"
"Remember, calling this write() method will advance the file position of the RandomAccessFile by 1.","['access: (write(), advance the file position of, randomaccessfile)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (write(), advance the file position of, randomaccessfile)""]"
Writing to a RandomAccessFile can be done using one it its many write() methods.,,[]
Just like with the read() method the write() method advances the file pointer after being called.,"['similarity: (read(), advances the file pointer after being called, write())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (read(), advances the file pointer after being called, write())""]"
The RandomAccessFile has a close() method which must be called when you are done using the RandomAccessFile instance.,"['dependency: (randomaccessfile, must be called when you are done using, close())', 'access: (randomaccessfile, has a, close())']",[]
You can see example of calls to close() in the examples above.,,[]
"The Java Reader class, java.io.Reader, is the base class for all Reader subclasses in the Java IO API.",,[]
"This is done when you instantiate the Reader (actually, when you instantiate one of its subclasses).",,[]
You will normally use a Reader subclass rather than a Reader directly.,,[]
Here is an example of creating a Java FileReader which is a subclass of Java Reader:,"['example: (java.io.filereader, is an example of, java.io.reader)', 'dependency: (java.io.filereader, is a subclass of, java.io.reader)']",[]
The read() method of a Java Reader returns an int which contains the char value of the next character read.,,[]
"If the read() method returns -1, there is no more data to read in the Reader, and it can be closed.",[],[]
"If not, it processes that char and continues reading until -1 is returned from the Reader read() method.",,[]
"The Java Reader class also has a read() method that takes a char array as parameter, as well as a start offset and length.","['access: (reader, has a, read())']",[]
The Java Reader class has a method named skip() which can be used to skip over a number of characters in the input that you do not want to read.,"['dependency: (skip(), uses, reader)', 'access: (skip(), skip characters in, reader)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (skip(), uses, reader)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (skip(), skip characters in, reader)""]"
The Java StreamTokenizer class (java.io.StreamTokenizer) can tokenize the characters read from a Reader into tokens.,"['transfer: (java.io.streamtokenizer, tokenize the characters read from, java.io.reader)']","[""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (java.io.streamtokenizer, tokenize the characters read from, java.io.reader)""]"
You do so by calling the nextToken() method of the StreamTokenizer inside a loop.,,[]
"After each call to nextToken() the StreamTokenizer has several fields you can read to see what kind of token was read, it's value etc.",,[]
"Java has 3 streams called System.in, System.out, and System.err which are commonly used to provide input to, and output from Java applications.","['alternative: (system.in, commonly used to provide input to java applications, system.out)', 'alternative: (system.in, commonly used to provide input to java applications, system.err)', 'alternative: (system.out, commonly used to provide output from java applications, system.in)', 'alternative: (system.out, commonly used to provide output from java applications, system.err)']",[]
Most commonly used is probably System.out for writing output to the console from console programs (command line applications).,,[]

System.in is an InputStream which is typically connected to keyboard input of console programs.,"['example: (system.in, is an example of, inputstream)', 'reference: (system.in, is a, inputstream)', 'dependency: (system.in, connected to, inputstream)']",[]
"In other words, if you start a Java application from the command line, and you type something on the keyboard while the CLI console (or terminal) has focus, the keyboard input can typically be read via System.in from inside that Java application.",,[]
"However, it is only keyboard input directed to that Java application (the console / terminnal that started the application) which can be read via System.in.",,[]
Keyboard input for other applications cannot be read via System.in .,,[]
"System.in is not used as often since data is commonly passed to a command line Java application via command line arguments, files, or possibly via network connections if the application is designed for that.",,[]
System.out normally outputs the data you write to it to the CLI console / terminal.,,[]
System.out is often used from console-only programs like command line tools as a way to display the result of their execution to the user.,,[]
System.err works like System.out except it is normally only used to output error texts.,"['alternative: (system.err, used instead of, system.out)', 'similarity: (system.err, works like, system.out)', 'difference: (system.err, only used to output error texts, system.out)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (system.err, used instead of, system.out)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (system.err, works like, system.out)"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (system.err, only used to output error texts, system.out)""]"
"Some programs (like Eclipse) will show the output to System.err in red text, to make it more obvious that it is error text.",,[]
"Even if the 3 System streams are static members of the java.lang.System class, and are pre-instantiated at JVM startup, you can change what streams to use for each of them.",,[]
"Just set a new InputStream for System.in or a new OutputStream for System.out or System.err, and all further data will be read / written to the new stream.","['alternative: (system.in, can be replaced with, inputstream)', 'alternative: (system.out, can be replaced with, outputstream)', 'alternative: (system.err, can be replaced with, outputstream)', 'transfer: (inputstream, read data from, system.in)', 'transfer: (system.out, write data to, outputstream)', 'transfer: (system.err, write data to, outputstream)']","[""('class', 'transfer', 'method'): (inputstream, read data from, system.in)"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (system.out, write data to, outputstream)"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (system.err, write data to, outputstream)""]"

The Java Writer class (java.io.Writer) is the base class for all Writer subclasses in the Java IO API.,,[]
"The Java Writer subclasses can normally handle UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding for you, so you don't have to worry about that.",,[]
You will normally use a Writer subclass rather than a Writer directly.,,[]
The Java Writer's flush() method flushes all data written to the Writer to the underlying data destination.,,[]
"By calling flush() you can assure that any buffered data will be flushed (written) to disk (or network, or whatever else the destination of your Writer has).",,[]
Here is an example of flushing data written to a Java Writer by calling its flush() method:,,[]
"The concrete implementations of hasMoreCharacters() and getNextCharacter() are left out, but they are not really super important to understand the principle of this example.","['dependency: (hasmorecharacters(), are not really super important to understand the principle of this example, getnextcharacter())', 'implementation: (hasmorecharacters(), concrete implementations are left out, getnextcharacter())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (hasmorecharacters(), are not really super important to understand the principle of this example, getnextcharacter())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (hasmorecharacters(), concrete implementations are left out, getnextcharacter())""]"
"What matters is, that once the while loop ends, and you are done writing data to the Writer, its close() method is called, which closes the Writer .",,[]
"Once the try block is exited, the close() method of the Writer is called automatically, because the Writer was declared inside the parentheses of the try block.","['dependency: (close(), is called automatically, writer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (close(), is called automatically, writer)""]"
"The SQL dialect used by the various different databases will vary slightly, so to be 100% database independent, you SQL must also be 100% database independent (i.e.",,[]

A java.sql.CallableStatement is used to call stored procedures in a database.,,[]
"A stored procedure is like a function or method in a class, except it lives inside the database.",,[]

This is how calling getConnection() only with the URL as parameter looks:,,[]
"The second variant of getConnection() takes both a database URL, a user name and a password as parameters.",,[]
Here is an example of calling that variant of getConnection() :,,[]
The third variant of getConnection() takes a database URL and a Properties object as parameter.,,[]
"The JDBC Connection setAutoCommit() method is used to switch the connection into, or out of, auto commit mode.",,[]
"When not in auto commit mode, each database transaction must be explicitly committed by calling the Connection commit() method.",,[]

The Java JDBC Connection rollback() method rolls back the operations executed within the currently ongoing transaction.,,[]
Exactly how to handle the calls to commit() and / or rollback() is covered in the JDBC Transactions Tutorial.,"['alternative: (commit(), or, rollback())', 'reference: (calls, to, commit())', 'reference: (calls, to, rollback())', 'example: (jdbc transactions tutorial, covered in, commit())', 'example: (jdbc transactions tutorial, covered in, rollback())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (commit(), or, rollback())""]"

The DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetHoldability(int holdability) returns true or false depending on whether the given holdability mode is supported or not.,,[]
The CLOSE_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT holdability means that all ResultSet instances are closed when connection.commit() method is called on the connection that created the ResultSet.,,[]
The HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT holdability means that the ResultSet is kept open when the connection.commit() method is called on the connection that created the ResultSet.,,[]

"A Java abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create new instances of an abstract class.",,[]
The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses.,,[]
"This Java abstract class tutorial explains how abstract classes are created in Java, what rules apply to them.",,[]
This tutorial gets into the purpose of abstract classes in Java in more detail towards the end of this text.,,[]
In Java you declare that a class is abstract by adding the abstract keyword to the class declaration.,,[]
That is all there is to declaring an abstract class in Java.,,[]
"If you try to compile the code above the Java compiler will generate an error, saying that you cannot instantiate MyAbstractClass because it is an abstract class.",,[]
"If a class has an abstract method, the whole class must be declared abstract.",,[]
Not all methods in an abstract class have to be abstract methods.,,[]
An abstract class can have a mixture of abstract and non-abstract methods.,,[]
Subclasses of an abstract class must implement (override) all abstract methods of its abstract superclass.,,[]
The non-abstract methods of the superclass are just inherited as they are.,,[]
Notice how MySubClass has to implement the abstract method abstractMethod() from its abstract superclass MyAbstractClass.,,[]
"The only time a subclass of an abstract class is not forced to implement all abstract methods of its superclass, is if the subclass is also an abstract class.",,[]
The purpose of abstract classes is to function as base classes which can be extended by subclasses to create a full implementation.,,[]
"If the steps before and after the action are always the same, the 3-step process could be implemented in an abstract superclass with this Java code:",,[]
Subclasses of MyAbstractProcess can now extend MyAbstractProcess and just override the action() method.,,[]

"Of course, the MyAbstractProcess did not have to be an abstract class to function as a base class.",,[]
"However, by making the method to implement abstract, and thus the class too, you signal clearly to users of this class that this class should not be used as it is.",,[]
"Instead it should be used as a base class for a subclass, and that the abstract method should be implemented in the subclass.",,[]
The above example did not have a default implementation for the action() method.,,[]
In some cases your superclass might actually have a default implementation for the method that subclasses are supposed to override.,,[]

The rest of the code is inherited from the URLProcessorBase superclass.,,[]

This version of the Clock class contains a private constructor and a public constructor.,,[]
The private constructor is called from the public constructor (the statement this();).,,[]
The private constructor is also called from the static method newClock().,,[]
The above example only serves to show you that a private constructor can be called from public constructors and from static methods inside the same class.,,[]
"The default access modifier means that code inside the class itself as well as code inside classes in the same package as this class, can access the class, field, constructor or method which the default access modifier is assigned to.",,[]

"Therefore, the ClockReader class can read the time member variable of the Clock object, provided that ClockReader and Clock are located in the same Java package.","['access: (clockreader, read the time member variable of, clock)', 'dependency: (clockreader, located in the same java package as, clock)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (clockreader, located in the same java package as, clock)""]"
"The protected access modifier provides the same access as the default access modifier, with the addition that subclasses can access protected methods and member variables (fields) of the superclass.",,[]
This is true even if the subclass is not located in the same package as the superclass.,,[]
In the above example the subclass SmartClock has a method called getTimeInSeconds() which accesses the time variable of the superclass Clock.,,[]
"The Java access modifier public means that all code can access the class, field, constructor or method, regardless of where the accessing code is located.",,[]
The accessing code can be in a different class and different package.,"['access: (class, can be in a different, package)', 'dependency: (class, can be in a different, package)', 'containment: (package, can contain, class)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (package, can contain, class)""]"
The time field in the Clock class is marked with the public Java access modifier.,,[]
"Therefore, the ClockReader class can access the time field in the Clock no matter what package the ClockReader is located in.","['access: (clockreader, can access the time field, clock)']",[]
"It is important to keep in mind that the Java access modifier assigned to a Java class takes precedence over any access modifiers assigned to fields, constructors and methods of that class.",,[]
"If the class is marked with the default access modifier, then no other class outside the same Java package can access that class, including its constructors, fields and methods.",,[]
The Java access modifiers private and protected cannot be assigned to a class.,,[]
Java interfaces are meant to specify fields and methods that are publicly available in classes that implement the interfaces.,,[]
"When you create a subclass of some class, the methods in the subclass cannot have less accessible access modifiers assigned to them than they had in the superclass.",,[]
"For instance, if a method in the superclass is public then it must be public in the subclass too, in case the subclass overrides the method.",,[]
If a method in the superclass is protected then it must be either protected or public in the subclass.,,[]
"For instance, if a method is assigned the default access modifier in the superclass, then it is allowed to assign the overridden method in the subclass the public access modifier.",,[]
"The build process includes generating source code, compiling the source, generating XML files (e.g.",,[]
"You can place Java annotations above classes, interfaces, methods, method parameters, fields and local variables.",,[]
"Here is a bigger example with annotations above both the class, fields, methods, parameters and local variables:",,[]
"If your code uses deprecated classes, methods or fields, the compiler will give you a warning.",,[]
"If the method does not match a method in the superclass, the compiler will give you an error.",,[]
"In case someone changed the name of the overridden method in the superclass, your subclass method would no longer override it.",,[]
"In case the method doTheThing() in MySuperClass changes signature so that the same method in the subclass no longer overrides it, the compiler will generate an error.",,[]
"Annotations are defined in their own file, just like a Java class or interface.",,[]
"RetentionPolicy.CLASS means that the annotation is stored in the .class file, but not available at runtime.",,[]
"RetentionPolicy.SOURCE means that the annotation is only available in the source code, and not in the .class files and not a runtime.",,[]
"The second line declares an array of references to objects of the class MyClass, which symbolizes a class you have created yourself.",,[]
Personally I prefer to locate the square brackets [] after the data type (e.g.,,[]
Java allows you to create an array of references to any type of object (to instances of any class).,,[]
Notice how the values to be inserted into the array are listed inside the { ... } block.,,[]
"Of course, if the insertIntoArray() method is located in a different class than the above code, you would need an object of that class in order to be able to call the method.",,[]
"Or, if the insertIntoArray() method was static, you would need to put the class name and a dot in front of the method name.",,[]
"This removeFromArray() method takes two parameters: The array to remove the element from, and the index of the element to remove.",,[]
"Of course, if the removeFromArray() method is located in a different class than the above code, you would need an object of that class in order to be able to call the method.",,[]
"Or, if the removeFromArray() method was static, you would need to put the class name and a dot in front of the method name.",,[]
The example first sets the minVal to Integer.MAX_VALUE which is the highest possible value an int can take.,,[]
"Java contains a special utility class that makes it easier for you to perform many often used array operations like copying and sorting arrays, filling in data, searching in arrays etc.","['alternative: (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.sort)', 'alternative: (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.fill)', 'alternative: (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)', 'alternative: (java.util.arrays.sort, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.fill)', 'alternative: (java.util.arrays.sort, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)', 'alternative: (java.util.arrays.fill, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.sort)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.fill)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.copyof, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.sort, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.fill)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.sort, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (java.util.arrays.fill, can be used instead of, java.util.arrays.binarysearch)""]"
The utility class is called Arrays and is located in the standard Java package java.util.,,[]
I will cover a few of the methods found in this class in the following sections.,,[]
"Remember, in order to use java.util.Arrays in your Java classes you must import it.",,[]
Here is how importing java.util.Arrays could look in a Java class of your own:,,[]
It is this statement that imports the class java.util.Arrays into your Java class.,,[]
The second method to copy a Java array is to use the Arrays.copyOf() method.,,[]
The third method to copy a Java array is to use the Arrays.copyOfRange() method.,,[]
"The Arrays.copyOfRange() method copies a range of an array, not necessarily the full array.",,[]
Here is how copying a full array using Arrays.copyOfRange() in Java looks:,,[]
You can convert an Java array of primitive types to a String using the Arrays.toString() method.,,[]
Here is an example of how to convert an array of int to a String using Arrays.toString():,,[]
You can sort the elements of an array using the Arrays.sort() method.,,[]
After the for loop the array is converted to a String using Arrays.toString() and printed out to the console (command line).,,[]
The Arrays.sort() example shown earlier only works for Java arrays of primitive data types.,,[]
Here is first the class for the objects we want to sort:,,[]
The class Employee is a simple model of an employee (I have created the Employee class).,,[]
Here is first an example of sorting an array of Employee objects by their name using the Arrays.sort() method:,,[]
The array is of type Employee - the class I showed you earlier.,,[]
"As parameter to the Arrays.sort() method we pass the employee array, and a Comparator implementation which can determine the order of Employee objects.","['dependency: (arrays.sort, relies on, comparator)', 'implementation: (arrays.sort, uses, comparator)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (arrays.sort, relies on, comparator)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'interface'): (arrays.sort, uses, comparator)""]"
Anonymous implementations of interfaces are covered in my text about nested classes in Java.,,[]
What is important to catch in this example is the implementation of the compare() method of the anonymous inner implementation of the Comparator interface.,"['implementation: (compare(), implementation of, comparator)', 'dependency: (compare(), of, comparator)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'interface'): (compare(), implementation of, comparator)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (compare(), of, comparator)""]"
In the example above we simply call the String.compare() method which does the comparison for us (compares the employee names).,,[]
"Here is the example from before, with a modified implementation of the compare() method of the anonymous implementation of the Comparator interface:","['implementation: (compare(), modified implementation of the ... comparator interface, comparator)', 'reference: (compare(), of the anonymous implementation of the comparator interface, comparator)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'interface'): (compare(), modified implementation of the ... comparator interface, comparator)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'interface'): (compare(), of the anonymous implementation of the comparator interface, comparator)""]"
Notice how the compare() method returns the difference between the employee ids by subtracting one from the other.,,[]
"To compare the Employee objects in the array first by their name, and if that is the same, then by their employee id, the compare() implementation would look like this:",,[]
These Arrays.fill() methods can fill an array with a given value.,,[]
Here is an example of using Arrays.fill() to fill an int array:,,[]
"There is a version of the Arrays.fill() method which takes a from and to index, so only elements with indexes in this interval are filled with the given value.",,[]
"You can do so yourself, or via the Arrays.sort() method covered earlier in this text.",,[]
The binarySearch() method will return the index in the array in which the element was found.,,[]
"If all elements in the array are smaller than the sought value, then binarySearch() will return - length of the array - 1.",,[]
Therefore binarySearch() will return -length (-6) - 1 = -6 -1 = -7.,,[]
The Arrays.binarySearch() method also exists in a version where you just search part of the array.,,[]
"This version of binarySearch() works just like the other version, except in the cases where no matching element is found.",,[]
"If no element is found matching within the index interval, then binarySearch() will still return the index of where the value should have been inserted.",,[]
"But, if all values in the interval are smaller than the sought value, binarySearch() will return -toIndex -1 , and not -array length - 1.",,[]
The java.util.Arrays class contains a set of methods called equals() which can be used to check if two Java arrays are equal.,"['containment: (java.util.arrays, contains, equals())', 'access: (java.util.arrays, access, equals())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (java.util.arrays, contains, equals())""]"
"Java classes are some of the core building blocks of Java applications, toolkits, frameworks, APIs etc.",,[]
"A small Java application may consist of a single Java class with a main() method in, as covered in the Java main method tutorial.",,[]
"As your Java application grows, keeping all the code in the same class makes it harder and harder to keep an overview of the code.",,[]
Therefore it might be beneficial to start splitting the Java code up into multiple classes.,,[]
"A Java class is a single, coherent unit of Java code which belongs together.",,[]
A Java class may contain a mix of data (variables) and actions (methods).,,[]
Grouping variables and operations on these variables into Java classes makes it easier to structure your Java program when it gets too big to fit comfortably inside a single Java class.,,[]
"Therefore, as the class grows, the file you are editing grows too, and becomes harder to keep an overview of in your head.",,[]
"Your Java application will typically have to contain at least a single Java class, but it may contain as many classes as you see fit to divide your application into.",,[]
"Java also comes with a lot of predefined classes for you, so you don't have to code every little function you might desire yourself.",,[]
"Fields are variables (data) that are local to the class, or instances (objects) of that class.",,[]
Methods are operations that the class or instances of that class can perform.,,[]
Nested classes are Java classes that are defined inside another class.,,[]
"Nested classes are typically intended to either be used only internally be the Java class that contains them, or to be used in connection with the class that contains them.",,[]
Nested classes are covered in more detail in my Java nested class tutorial.,,[]
"Sometimes you have classes that only contain fields (data), and sometimes you have classes that only contain methods (operations).",,[]
It depends on what the Java class is supposed to do.,,[]
All it takes to define a class in Java is this:,,[]
The above class definition should be put in its own file named MyClass.java.,,[]
"Java files should be named the same as the name of the class they contain, with the .java as file name extension.",,[]
Make sure you keep the same uppercase and lowercase characters from the class name in the file name too.,,[]
"Only put a single class definition in each Java file, unless your class contains inner classes of some kind.",,[]
"As mentioned earlier, a Java class can contain data in the shape of variables.",,[]
The next example shows a Java class which is to model a car.,,[]
A constructor is a special method that is called when an object of the given class is created (explained later).,,[]
The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the fields in the class.,,[]
Here is an example of a Java class with two constructors:,,[]
"The constructors are the two methods that have the same name as the class, and which have no return type specified.",,[]
"A Java method contains Java instructions that typically perform some operations on a field in the class, or on one of the parameters (also variables) values passed to the method when the method was called.",,[]
"Here is the Java class, Car example from the previous section with a method added:",,[]
In the class definition above I have added a setColor() method.,,[]
"As mentioned earlier, you can define a nested class inside another Java class.",,[]
Here is an example of defining a nested class inside a Java class:,,[]
"In the example above, the outer class is called MyClass and the nested class is called MyNestedClass .",,[]
"Neither of the classes in this example has any fields or methods, but both the outer and nested class could have as many fields and methods as you see fit.",,[]
You can read more about nested classes in my tutorial about nested classes in Java,,[]
A Java class is a template for how objects of that class looks.,,[]
"In other words, the Car class in the previous section is a template for how Car objects look.",,[]
"To create objects of a certain class, you use the new keyword.",,[]
"This example creates 3 Car variables, and assign a new instance of the Car class to each variable.",,[]
"Thus, the fields of different objects (even of the same class) can vary independently of each other.",,[]
"After creating the 3 Car objects, the setColor() method is called on each object.",,[]
"Creating an object of a certain class is also called ""instantiating"" an object.",,[]
"The object is thus also called an ""instance"" of the given class.",,[]
"For instance, each of the Car objects above are also called an instance of the Car class, or simply ""Car instances"".",,[]
What you have seen in this text only covers the very basics of Java classes.,,[]
"You need to learn about fields, constructors, methods nested classes, abstract classes, inheritance, access modifiers and interfaces too.",,[]
"Here is a simple example that creates an object, which results in the class constructor being called:",,[]
The example shows a very simple Java class with a single constructor.,,[]
The second part of a Java constructor declaration is the name of the class the constructor belongs to.,,[]
Using the class name for the constructor signals to the Java compiler that this is a constructor.,,[]
The constructor parameters are declared inside the parentheses () after the class name part of the constructor .,,[]
"A class can have multiple constructors, as long as their signature (the parameters they take) are not the same.",,[]
"When a Java class contains multiple constructors, we say that the constructor is overloaded (comes in multiple versions).",,[]
"This is what constructor overloading means, that a Java class contains multiple constructors.",,[]
The keyword this in front of the field name (this.number) is not necessary.,,[]
"You don't have to define a constructor for a class, but if you don't define any constructor, the Java compiler will insert a default, no-argument constructor for you.",,[]
"Thus, once the class is compiled it will always at least have a no-argument constructor.",,[]
"If you do define a constructor for your class, then the Java compiler will not insert the default no-argument constructor into your class.",,[]
The parameters are passed to the constructor inside the parentheses after the class name on the right side of the equal sign.,,[]
"By default, if a parameter (or local variable) has the same name as a field in the same class, the parameter (or local variable) ""shadows"" for the field.",,[]
"Inside the constructor of the Employee class the firstName, lastName and birthYear identifiers now refer to the constructor parameters, not to the Employee fields with the same names.",,[]
"To signal to the Java compiler that you mean the fields of the Employee class and not the parameters, put the this keyword and a dot in front of the field name.",,[]
You call a constructor when you create a new instance of the class containing the constructor.,,[]
"In case you want to pass parameters to the constructor, you include the parameters between the parentheses after the class name, like this:",,[]
The this keyword followed by parentheses and parameters means that another constructor in the same Java class is being called.,,[]
In this example it is the first constructor in the class that is being called.,,[]
"When a class extends another class it is also said to ""inherit"" from the class it extends.",,[]
"The class that extends is called the subclass, and the class being extended is called the superclass.",,[]
A class that extends another class does not inherit its constructors.,,[]
"However, the subclass must call a constructor in the superclass inside of its the subclass constructors!",,[]
"If a subclass calls another constructor within itself, then the called constructor must call the superclass constructor.",,[]
It calls the constructor in the superclass using this Java statement:,,[]
Using the keyword super refers to the superclass of the class using the super keyword.,,[]
"When super keyword is followed by parentheses like it is here, it refers to a constructor in the superclass.",,[]
In this case it refers to the constructor in the Vehicle class.,,[]
The access modifier of a constructor determines what classes in your application that are allowed to call that constructor.,,[]
"For instance, if a constructor is declared protected then only classes in the same package, or subclasses of that class can call that constructor.",,[]
"A class can have multiple constructors, and each constructor can have its own access modifier.",,[]
"Thus, some constructors may be available to all classes in your application, while other constructors are only available to classes in the same package, subclasses, or even only to the class itself (private constructors).","['reference: (constructor, some, constructors)', 'containment: (constructor, other, constructors)', 'access: (constructor, available to, constructors)', 'access: (constructor, available to all classes, constructors)', 'access: (constructor, available to classes in the same package, constructors)', 'access: (constructor, available to subclasses, constructors)', 'access: (constructor, available to the class itself, constructors)']","[""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (constructor, some, constructors)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (constructor, available to, constructors)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (constructor, available to all classes, constructors)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (constructor, available to classes in the same package, constructors)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (constructor, available to subclasses, constructors)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (constructor, available to the class itself, constructors)""]"
Here is an example of a Java class with a constructor that can throw an exception:,,[]
Making a constructor throw an exception can be a good idea if you want to prevent an object of the given class to be created in an invalid state.,,[]
"A class can have fields, constructors and methods (plus more, but that is not important now).",,[]
"When you create an object, that object is of a certain class.",,[]
The class is like a template (or blueprint) telling how objects of that class should look.,,[]
"When you create an object, you say ""give me an object of this class"".",,[]
"If you think of a factory producing lots and lots of the same items, then the class would be the blueprint / manual of how the finished product should look, and the objects would be each of the finished products.",,[]
"If the factory produced cars, then the blueprint / design manual of the cars to produce corresponds to a Java class, and the physical cars produced corresponds to Java objects.",,[]
Here is a simple diagram illustrating the principle of objects being of a certain class.,,[]
The class determines what fields and methods the objects of that class have.,"['containment: (class, determines what fields and methods, method)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (class, determines what fields and methods, method)""]"
"The Car class does not contain any fields, constructors or methods.",,[]
The example primarily serves to show you an example of how a class declaration looks in Java code.,,[]
A field is a variable that belongs to a class or an object.,,[]
"For instance, a Car class could define the field brand which all Car objects would have.",,[]
Here is the Car class declaration from above with a field name brand added:,,[]
Constructors are a special kind of method that is executed when an object of that class is created.,,[]
Here is the Car class from before with a constructor that initializes the brand field:,,[]
"Here is the Car class from before with a single, simple method named getBrand added:","['access: (car, getbrand, getbrand)', 'reference: (car, getbrand, getbrand)']",[]
"When a class implements an interface, the class has to implement all the methods described in the interface.",,[]
"Packages provides a handy way of grouping related classes and interfaces, thus making modularization of your Java code easier.",,[]
"That these are primitive data types means that they are not objects, nor references to objects (classes and objects are explained in later texts in this Java tutorial).",,[]
You can also create your own more complex data types by creating custom classes.,,[]
"More precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class.","['reference: (java.lang.enum, is a special kind of, java.lang.class)', 'containment: (java.lang.class, contains, java.lang.enum)']","[""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (java.lang.enum, is a special kind of, java.lang.class)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java.lang.class, contains, java.lang.enum)""]"
Notice the enum keyword which is used in place of class or interface.,,[]
Replace the ... with the code to execute if the level variable matches the given Level constant value.,,[]
You can obtain an array of all the possible values of a Java enum type by calling its static values() method.,,[]
All enum types get a static values() method automatically by the Java compiler.,,[]
An enum class automatically gets a toString() method in the class when compiled.,,[]
The toString() method returns a string value of the name of the given enum instance.,,[]
"Then the toString() method will get called behind the scenes, so the value that will be printed out is the textual name of the enum instance.",,[]
An enum class automatically gets a static valueOf() method in the class when compiled.,,[]
The valueOf() method can be used to obtain an instance of the enum class for a given String value.,,[]
The level variable will point to the Level.HIGH after executing this line.,,[]
It is possible for a Java enum class to have abstract methods too.,,[]
"If an enum class has an abstract method, then each instance of the enum class must implement it.",,[]
Notice the abstract method declaration at the bottom of the enum class.,,[]
It is the method getDescription() that comes from the interface MyInterface.,"['dependency: (getdescription(), comes from, myinterface)', 'implementation: (getdescription(), implemented in, myinterface)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (getdescription(), comes from, myinterface)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'interface'): (getdescription(), implemented in, myinterface)""]"
"Java enums extend the java.lang.Enum class implicitly, so your enum types cannot extend another class.",,[]
"The purpose of this exercise is to verify that you know how to create classes, how to create instance variables inside the classes, how to create an array of objects and how to iterate that array while referencing the objects in it.",,[]
"For instance, in a class representing an employee, the Employee class might contain the following fields:",,[]
The access modifier determines which object classes that can access the field.,,[]
"In Java, static fields belongs to the class, not instances of the class.",,[]
"Thus, all instances of any class will access the same static field variable.",,[]
A non-static field value can be different for every object (instance) of a class.,,[]
The Java field access modifier determines whether the field can be accessed by classes other than the the class owning the field.,,[]
The private access modifier means that only code inside the class itself can access this Java field.,,[]
"The package access modifier means that only code inside the class itself, or other classes in the same package, can access the field.","['access: (package, can access, class)', 'access: (class, can access, class)', 'containment: (package, contains, class)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (package, contains, class)""]"
"The protected access modifier is like the package modifier, except subclasses of the class can also access the field, even if the subclass is not located in the same package.",,[]
The public access modifier means that the field can be accessed by all classes in your application.,,[]
You would probably not use all access modifiers in the same class.,,[]
"For simple, data carrying classes you may declare all fields public.",,[]
"Thus, no matter how many objects you create of that class, there will only exist one field located in the class, and the value of that field is the same, no matter from which object it is accessed.",,[]
"Static fields are located in the class, so you don't need an instance of the class to access static fields.",,[]
"Non-static Java fields, on the other hand, are located in the instances of the class.",,[]
Each instance of the class can have its own values for these fields.,,[]
To access a non-static field you need an instance of the class (an object) on which you can access it.,,[]
"That means, that even if the field belongs to objects (class instances), you cannot vary the value of the field from object to object.",,[]
"That way it only exists in the class, not in every object too.",,[]
"The first line creates a new Customer object (an instance of the Customer class), and stores it in a variable called customer.",,[]
A class is loaded the first time it is referenced in your program.,,[]
"Inside the parentheses () after the for keyword, are three statements separated by semicolon (;).",,[]
"In this example, only the first System.out.println() statement is executed inside the for loop.",,[]
The second System.out.println() statement is not executed until after the for loop is finished.,,[]
"Second, inside the isValid() method the String.equals() method is used to test for equality to a certain string value.",,[]
The isValid() method could actually have been written in a shorter way.,,[]
Now the isValid() method returns the value returned by the value.equals() method call.,"['dependency: (isvalid(), returns the value returned by, equals())', 'reference: (isvalid(), uses the return value of, equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (isvalid(), returns the value returned by, equals())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (isvalid(), uses the return value of, equals())""]"
Java inheritance refers to the ability in Java for one class to inherit from another class.,,[]
One class can extend another class and thereby inherit from that class.,,[]
"When one class inherits from another class in Java, the two classes take on certain roles.",,[]
The class that extends (inherits from another class) is the subclass and the class that is being extended (the class being inherited from) is the superclass .,,[]
"A subclass is a specialization of a superclass, and a superclass is a generalization of one or more subclasses.",,[]
"Inheritance can be an effective method to share code between classes that have some traits in common, yet allowing the classes to have some parts that are different.",,[]
"Here is diagram illustrating a class called Vehicle, which has two subclasses called Car and Truck.",,[]
The Vehicle class can contain those fields and methods that all Vehicles need (e.g.,,[]
Note: Some people will claim that inheritance is a way to categorize your classes based on what they are.,,[]
"In practice, however, that is not how you determine which superclasses and subclasses your application needs to have.",,[]
Then it makes sense to have a common Vehicle superclass for the two classes.,,[]
"If you never process Car and Truck objects in the same way, there is no point in having a common superclass for them, except perhaps to share code between them (to avoid writing duplicate code).",,[]
Superclasses and subclasses form an inheritance structure which is also called a class hierarchy.,,[]
At the top of the class hierarchy you have the superclasses.,,[]
At the bottom of the class hierarchy you have the subclasses.,,[]
"A class hierarchy may have multiple levels, meaning multiple levels of superclasses and subclasses.",,[]
A subclass may itself be a superclass of other subclasses etc.,,[]
"When a class inherits from a superclass, it inherits parts of the superclass methods and fields.",,[]
"When a subclass extends a superclass in Java, all protected and public fields and methods of the superclass are inherited by the subclass.",,[]
"By inherited is meant that these fields and methods are part of of the subclass, as if the subclass had declared them itself.",,[]
protected and public fields can be called and referenced just like the methods declared directly in the subclass.,,[]
Fields and methods with default (package) access modifiers can be accessed by subclasses only if the subclass is located in the same package as the superclass.,,[]
Private fields and methods of the superclass can never be referenced directly by subclasses.,,[]
"They can, however, be referenced indirectly via methods reachable from the subclass (e.g default (package), protected and public methods).","['alternative: (default, reachable from subclass, protected)', 'alternative: (default, reachable from subclass, public)', 'alternative: (protected, reachable from subclass, public)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (default, reachable from subclass, protected)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (default, reachable from subclass, public)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (protected, reachable from subclass, public)""]"
"Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but a subclass constructor must call a constructor in the superclass.",,[]
The Java inheritance mechanism only allows a Java class to inherit from a single superclass (singular inheritance).,,[]
"In some programming languages, like C++, it is possible for a subclass to inherit from multiple superclasses (multiple inheritance).",,[]
"the superclasses contain methods with the same names and parameters, multiple inheritance was left out in Java.",,[]
You declare that one class extends another class by using the extends keyword in the class definition.,,[]
"The Car class in this example extends the Vehicle class, meaning the Car class inherits from the Vehicle class.","['dependency: (car, inherits from, vehicle)', 'example: (car, is an example of, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, inherits from, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (car, is an example of, vehicle)""]"
"Because the Car class extends the Vehicle class, the protected field licensePlate from the Vehicle class is inherited by the Car class.","['dependency: (car, extends, vehicle)', 'access: (car, inherits, vehicle)', 'containment: (vehicle, contains, licenseplate)', 'access: (car, inherited, licenseplate)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, extends, vehicle)""]"
"The licensePlate field is not actually being referenced from the Car class in the code above, but it could if we wanted to.",,[]
In many cases it would have made sense to place the getLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class where the licensePlate field is located.,,[]
I just placed the getLicensePlate() method in the Car class to show that it is possible.,,[]
It is possible to reference a subclass as an instance of one of its superclasses.,,[]
"For instance, using the class definitions from the example in the previous section it is possible to reference an instance of the Car class as an instance of the Vehicle class.",,[]
"Because the Car class extends (inherits from) the Vehicle class, it is also said to be a Vehicle.","['dependency: (car, inherits from, vehicle)', 'example: (car, is a, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, inherits from, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (car, is a, vehicle)""]"
Here is a Java code example: Car car = new Car(); Vehicle vehicle = car; First a Car instance is created.,,[]
This is possible because the Car class inherits from the Vehicle class.,"['dependency: (car, inherits from, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, inherits from, vehicle)""]"
"As you can see, it is possible to use an instance of some subclass as if it were an instance of its superclass.",,[]
"That way, you don't need to know exactly what subclass the object is an instance of.",,[]
The process of referencing an object of class as a different type than the class itself is called type casting.,,[]
Upcasting and Downcasting You can always cast an object of a subclass to one of its superclasses.,,[]
This is referred to as upcasting (from a subclass type to a superclass type).,,[]
"It may also be possible to cast an object from a superclass type to a subclass type, but only if the object really is an instance of that subclass (or an instance of a subclass of that subclass).",,[]
This is referred to as downcasting (from a superclass type to a subclass type).,,[]
"Thus, this example of downcasting is valid: Car car = new Car(); // upcast to Vehicle Vehicle vehicle = car; // downcast to car again Car car2 = (Car) vehicle; However, the following downcast example is not valid.",,[]
"Truck truck = new Truck(); // upcast to Vehicle Vehicle vehicle = truck; // downcast to car again Car car = (Car) vehicle; The Truck object can be upcast to a Vehicle object, but it cannot be downcast to a Car object later.","['conversion: (truck(), upcast, vehicle())', 'conversion: (vehicle(), downcast, car())', 'reference: (vehicle(), assign, car())', 'alternative: (truck(), cannot be downcast, car())']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (truck(), upcast, vehicle())"", ""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (vehicle(), downcast, car())"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (vehicle(), assign, car())"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (truck(), cannot be downcast, car())""]"
Overriding Methods In a subclass you can override (redefine) methods defined in the superclass.,,[]
Here is a Java method override example: public class Vehicle { String licensePlate = null; public void setLicensePlate(String licensePlate) { this.licensePlate = licensePlate; } } public class Car extends Vehicle { public void setLicensePlate(String license) { this.licensePlate = license.toLowerCase(); } } Notice how both the Vehicle class and the Car class defines a method called setLicensePlate().,"['conversion: (setlicenseplate(), converts to lowercase, tolowercase())', 'implementation: (setlicenseplate(), invokes, tolowercase())', 'dependency: (setlicenseplate(), depends on, tolowercase())', 'example: (setlicenseplate(), uses, tolowercase())', 'containment: (setlicenseplate(), contains, tolowercase())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), invokes, tolowercase())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), depends on, tolowercase())""]"
"Now, whenever the setLicensePlate() method is called on a Car object, it is the method defined in the Car class that is called.",,[]
To override a method the method signature in the subclass must be the same as in the superclass.,,[]
"That means that the method definition in the subclass must have exactly the same name and the same number and type of parameters, and the parameters must be listed in the exact same sequence as in the superclass.",,[]
Otherwise the method in the subclass will be considered a separate method.,,[]
"If the superclass calls a private method internally from some other method, it will continue to call that method from the superclass, even if you create a private method in the subclass with the same signature.",,[]
"It would be nice if the compiler could tell you that the method being overridden no longer overrides a method in the superclass, right?",,[]
"You can call superclass implementations from any method in a subclass, like above.",,[]
"For instance, you could also have called super.setLicensePlate() from a method in the Car class called updateLicensePlate() which does not override the setLicensePlate() method.","['reference: (updatelicenseplate(), called, setlicenseplate())', 'alternative: (updatelicenseplate(), could also have called, setlicenseplate())', 'implementation: (updatelicenseplate(), does not override, setlicenseplate())']","[""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (updatelicenseplate(), called, setlicenseplate())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (updatelicenseplate(), could also have called, setlicenseplate())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (updatelicenseplate(), does not override, setlicenseplate())""]"
The instanceof instruction can determine whether a given object is an instance of some class.,,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example: Car car = new Car(); boolean isCar = car instanceof Car; After this code has been executed the isCar variable will contain the value true.,,[]
The instanceof instruction can also be used determine if an object is a instance of a superclass of its class.,,[]
"Here is an instanceof example that checks if a Car object is an instance of Vehicle: Car car = new Car(); boolean isVehicle = car instanceof Vehicle; Assuming that the Car class extends (inherits from) the Vehicle class, the isVehicle variable will contain the value true after this code is executed.","['example: (car(), is an instance of, vehicle())', 'check: (car(), instanceof, vehicle())', 'dependency: (car(), inherits from, vehicle())', 'reference: (car(), is an instance of, vehicle())']","[""('class', 'example', 'class'): (car(), is an instance of, vehicle())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car(), inherits from, vehicle())"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (car(), is an instance of, vehicle())""]"
A Car object is also a Vehicle object because Car is a subclass of Vehicle.,"['example: (car, is a subclass of, vehicle)', 'containment: (car, is a, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'example', 'class'): (car, is a subclass of, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (car, is a, vehicle)""]"
"Look at this instanceof example: Car car = new Car(); Vehicle vehicle = car; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; Even though the vehicle variable is of type Vehicle, the object it ends up pointing to in this example is a Car object.","['reference: (car, points to, vehicle)', 'example: (car, instanceof example, vehicle)', 'creation: (car, new car(), vehicle)', 'conversion: (car, is a, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (car, points to, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (car, instanceof example, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (car, new car(), vehicle)"", ""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (car, is a, vehicle)""]"
"Here is the same instanceof example, but using a Truck object instead of a Car object: Truck truck = new Truck(); Vehicle vehicle = truck; boolean isCar = vehicle instanceof Car; After executing this code the isCar will contain the value false.","['example: (truck(), using a truck object instead of a car object, car())', 'reference: (truck(), truck =, vehicle())', 'check: (vehicle(), vehicle instanceof car, car())']","[""('class', 'example', 'class'): (truck(), using a truck object instead of a car object, car())"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (truck(), truck =, vehicle())""]"
"Fields and Inheritance As mentioned earlier, in Java fields cannot be overridden in a subclass.",,[]
"If you define a field in a subclass with the same name as a field in the superclass, the field in the subclass will hide (shadow) the field in the superclass.",,[]
"If the subclass tries to access the field, it will access the field in the subclass.",,[]
"If, however, the subclass calls up into a method in the superclass, and that method accesses the field with the same name as in the subclass, it is the field in the superclass that is accessed.",,[]
Both the Vehicle class and Car class has the methods setLicensePlate() and getLicensePlate().,"['access: (vehicle, has, getlicenseplate())', 'access: (car, has, getlicenseplate())', 'access: (vehicle, has, setlicenseplate())', 'access: (car, has, setlicenseplate())']",[]
The methods in the Car class calls the corresponding methods in the Vehicle class.,"['dependency: (car, calls methods in, vehicle)', 'implementation: (car, calls methods in, vehicle)', 'reference: (car, calls methods in, vehicle)', 'access: (car, calls methods in, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, calls methods in, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'class'): (car, calls methods in, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (car, calls methods in, vehicle)""]"
"The result is, that eventually both set of methods access the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class.",,[]
"The updateLicensePlate() method in the Car class however, accesses the licensePlate field directly.",,[]
"Therefore, you will not get the same result if you call setLicensePlate() as when you call the updateLicense() method.","['difference: (setlicenseplate(), not get the same result, updatelicense())', 'alternative: (setlicenseplate(), instead of, updatelicense())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), not get the same result, updatelicense())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), instead of, updatelicense())""]"
"Look at the following lines of Java code: Car car = new Car(); car.setLicensePlate(""123""); car.updateLicensePlate(""abc""); System.out.println(""license plate: "" + car.getLicensePlate()); This Java code will print out the text 123.",,[]
The updateLicensePlate() method sets the license plate value on the licensePlate field in the Car class.,,[]
"The getLicensePlate() method, however, returns the value of the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class.",,[]
"Therefore, the value 123 which is set as value for the licensePlate field in the Vehicle class via the setLicensePlate() method, is what is printed out.",,[]
"In other words, constructors of a superclass are not inherited by subclasses.",,[]
Subclasses can still call the constructors in the superclass using the super() contruct.,,[]
"In fact, a subclass constructor is required to call one of the constructors in the superclass as the very first action inside the constructor body.",,[]
Here is how that looks: public class Vehicle { public Vehicle() { } } public class Car extends Vehicle{ public Car() { super(); //perform other initialization here } } Notice the call to super() inside the Car constructor.,"['dependency: (car(), extends, vehicle())', 'reference: (car(), super(), vehicle())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car(), extends, vehicle())"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (car(), super(), vehicle())""]"
You may have seen Java classes where the subclass constructors did not seem to call the constructors in the superclass.,,[]
"However, the subclass constructors have still called superclass constructors in those case.",,[]
"Let me explain why: If a class does not have any explicit constructor defined, the Java compiler inserts an implicit no-arg constructor.",,[]
"Therefore the following version of Vehicle is equivalent to the version shown just above: public class Vehicle { } Second, if a constructor does not explicitly call a constructor in the superclass, the Java compiler inserts an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.",,[]
"That means that the following version of the Car class is actually equivalent to the version shown earlier: public class Car extends Vehicle{ public Car() { } } In fact, since the constructor is now empty, we could leave it out and the Java compiler would insert it, and insert an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.","['dependency: (car, extends, vehicle)', 'reference: (car, implicit call to the no-arg constructor in, vehicle)']",[]
"This is how the two classes would look then: public class Vehicle { } public class Car extends Vehicle{ } Even though no constructors are declared in these two classes, they both get a no-arg constructor, and the no-arg constructor in the Car class will call the no-arg constructor in the Vehicle class.",,[]
"If the Vehicle class did not have a no-arg constructor, but had another constructor which takes parameters, the Java compiler would complain.",,[]
"The Car class would then be required to declare a constructor, and inside that constructor call the constructor in the Vehicle class.","['dependency: (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)', 'reference: (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)', 'access: (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)', 'implementation: (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'class'): (car, call the constructor in, vehicle)""]"
Nested Classes and Inheritance The same Java inheritance rules apply to nested classes.,,[]
Nested classes with the default (package) access modifier are only accessible to subclasses if the subclass is located in the same package as the superclass.,,[]
Nested classes with the protected or public access modifier are always inherited by subclasses.,,[]
Here is a nested class inheritance example: class MyClass { class MyNestedClass { } } public class MySubclass extends MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) { MySubclass subclass = new MySubclass(); MyNestedClass nested = subclass.new MyNestedClass(); } } Notice how it is possible to create an instance of the nested class MyNestedClass which is defined in the superclass (MyClass) via a reference to the subclass (MySubclass).,"['containment: (myclass, contains, mynestedclass)', 'dependency: (mysubclass, inherits from, myclass)', 'creation: (mysubclass, creates an instance of, mynestedclass)', 'reference: (mysubclass, has a reference to, mynestedclass)', 'example: (myclass, is an example of a superclass for, mysubclass)', 'containment: (myclass, defines, mynestedclass)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (myclass, contains, mynestedclass)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (mysubclass, inherits from, myclass)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (mysubclass, creates an instance of, mynestedclass)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (mysubclass, has a reference to, mynestedclass)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (myclass, is an example of a superclass for, mysubclass)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (myclass, defines, mynestedclass)""]"
Here is now that looks: public final class MyClass { } A final class cannot be extended.,,[]
"In other words, you cannot inherit from a final class in Java.",,[]
Abstract Classes and Inheritance In Java a class can be declared abstract.,,[]
I have explained abstract classes in more detail in my Java abstract classes tutorial.,,[]
An abstract class is a class that does not contain the full implementation of whatever the abstract class should do.,,[]
"In other words, you cannot create objects of an abstract class.",,[]
In Java abstract classes are intended to be extended to create a full implementation.,,[]
The Java inheritance rules are the same for abstract classes as for non-abstract classes.,,[]
You can always cast an object of a subclass to one of its superclasses.,,[]
In a subclass you can override (redefine) methods defined in the superclass.,,[]
Notice how both the Vehicle class and the Car class defines a method called setLicensePlate().,,[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, and the method is all of a sudden removed or renamed or have its signature changed in the superclass, the method in the subclass no longer overrides the method in the superclass.",,[]
"If you override a method in a subclass, but still need to call the method defined in the superclass, you can do so using the super reference, like this:",,[]
"In the above code example the method setLicensePlate() in the Car class, calls the setLicensePlate() method in the Vehicle class.","['implementation: (setlicenseplate(), calls, setlicenseplate())', 'dependency: (setlicenseplate(), relies on, setlicenseplate())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), calls, setlicenseplate())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (setlicenseplate(), relies on, setlicenseplate())""]"
"Assuming that the Car class extends (inherits from) the Vehicle class, the isVehicle variable will contain the value true after this code is executed.",,[]
"As mentioned earlier, in Java fields cannot be overridden in a subclass.",,[]
Here is Java inheritance example that illustrates how fields in subclasses shadow (hides) fields in superclasses:,,[]
"If a class does not have any explicit constructor defined, the Java compiler inserts an implicit no-arg constructor.",,[]
"Second, if a constructor does not explicitly call a constructor in the superclass, the Java compiler inserts an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.",,[]
That means that the following version of the Car class is actually equivalent to the version shown earlier:,,[]
"In fact, since the constructor is now empty, we could leave it out and the Java compiler would insert it, and insert an implicit call to the no-arg constructor in the superclass.",,[]
"Even though no constructors are declared in these two classes, they both get a no-arg constructor, and the no-arg constructor in the Car class will call the no-arg constructor in the Vehicle class.","['dependency: (no-arg constructor, will call, no-arg constructor)', 'implementation: (no-arg constructor, call, no-arg constructor)', 'reference: (no-arg constructor, in, no-arg constructor)', 'containment: (no-arg constructor, in, no-arg constructor)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (no-arg constructor, will call, no-arg constructor)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (no-arg constructor, call, no-arg constructor)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (no-arg constructor, in, no-arg constructor)""]"
Notice how it is possible to create an instance of the nested class MyNestedClass which is defined in the superclass (MyClass) via a reference to the subclass (MySubclass).,,[]
"The Java instanceof operator can determine if a given Java object is an instance of a given class, superclass or interface.",,[]
The Java instanceof operator is also referred to as a type comparison operator because it compares the type of a given instance (object) with a specific type (class or interface).,,[]
"The expression map instanceof Object will evaluate to true if the map variable references an object that is an instance of class Object, or any subclass of class Object.",,[]
"Since all classes in Java inherit from Object, this expression will evaluate to true.",,[]
"As mentioned earlier, the Java instanceof operator will evaluate to true if you compare an object to the exact class of that object.",,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example showing a comparison of an object to its exact class:,,[]
"As also mentioned earlier, the Java instanceof operator also evaluates to true when comparing an object against a superclass of the type of that object.",,[]
"Since HashMap is a subclass of Object - even if not a direct subclass, the expression map instanceof Object evaluates to true.","['dependency: (hashmap, subclass of, object)', 'reference: (map, instanceof, object)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (hashmap, subclass of, object)""]"
"Note, that it does not matter how high up in the inheritance hierarchy the compared type is superclass of the type of the object.",,[]
"As long as the type compared to is a superclass somewhere up the inheritance hierarchy, instanceof will evaluate to true.",,[]
The Java instanceof operator also works when comparing an object against an interface instead of a class.,,[]
"Notice, that even if the map variable is of type HashMap, the instanceof operator returns true for the expression map instanceof Map because the HashMap class implements the Map interface.","['implementation: (hashmap, implements, map)', 'reference: (hashmap, instanceof, map)', 'dependency: (hashmap, instanceof, map)', 'example: (hashmap, is of type, map)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (hashmap, implements, map)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (hashmap, instanceof, map)"", ""('class', 'example', 'interface'): (hashmap, is of type, map)""]"
"The Java instanceof operator also evaluates to true when comparing an object against a superinterface which the class of the object, or a superclass of the object implements.",,[]
"The TreeMap class implements SortedMap, and thus also indirectly the Map interface.","['implementation: (treemap, implements, sortedmap)', 'dependency: (treemap, indirectly implements, map)', 'dependency: (sortedmap, subinterface of, map)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (treemap, implements, sortedmap)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (treemap, indirectly implements, map)"", ""('interface', 'dependency', 'interface'): (sortedmap, subinterface of, map)""]"
The Java instanceof operator always evaluates to false when a null variable is compared against any class or interface.,,[]
Here is a Java instanceof example illustrating the comparison of null against a class:,,[]
"That is because it is not the reference type that is compared against the target class or interface, but the actual type of the referenced object.",,[]
"Since a Java String object can never be an instance of the Java Integer class, the Java compiler will catch this an give you an error.","['difference: (java.lang.string, instance of, java.lang.integer)']",[]
That means that the actual class of the referenced object could be pretty much any class (since all classes are subclasses of Object).,,[]
"In short, we can avoid the explicit downcast of an object when comparing it against a subclass.",,[]
Notice the str variable after the String class name in the instanceof expression inside the if-statement.,,[]
"Since the right hand side of the expression is only evaluated if the left hand side evaluates to true, this cannot result in startsWith() being called on a non-String object.",,[]
"A question I get a lot is what the difference is between Java interfaces and abstract classes, and when to use each.",,[]
"Having answered this question by email multiple times, I decided to write this tutorial about Java interfaces vs abstract classes.",,[]
"In other words, to make the classes using the interface independent of the classes implementing the interface.",,[]
"Thus, you can exchange the implementation of the interface, without having to change the class using the interface.",,[]
Abstract classes are typically used as base classes for extension by subclasses.,,[]
"Some programming languages use abstract classes to achieve polymorphism, and to separate interface from implementation, but in Java you use interfaces for that.",,[]
"Remember, a Java class can only have 1 superclass, but it can implement multiple interfaces.",,[]
"Thus, if a class already has a different superclass, it can implement an interface, but it cannot extend another abstract class.",,[]
"If you also need to provide a base class or default implementation of the interface, add an abstract class (or normal class) that implements the interface.",,[]
"Here is an example showing a class referencing an interface, an abstract class implementing that interface, and a subclass extending the abstract class.",,[]
"Below are the code examples from the text on Java Abstract Classes, but with an interface added which is implemented by the abstract base class.",,[]
"Fourth, how to use the interface URLProcessor as variable type, even though it is the subclass UrlProcessorImpl that is instantiated.","['reference: (urlprocessor, interface, urlprocessorimpl)', 'implementation: (urlprocessor, instantiated, urlprocessorimpl)']",[]
Using both an interface and an abstract base class makes your code more flexible.,,[]
It possible to implement simple URL processors simply by subclassing the abstract base class.,,[]
"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.",,[]
"However, it is possible to provide default implememntations of a method in a Java interface, to make the implementation of the interface easier for classes implementing the interface.",,[]
"Just like with classes, a Java interface can be declared public or package scope (no access modifier).",,[]
"As you can see, accessing a variable from an interface is very similar to accessing a static variable in a class.",,[]
"The method, however, needs to be implemented by some class before you can access it.",,[]
"Before you can really use an interface, you must implement that interface in some Java class.",,[]
Here is a class that implements the MyInterface interface shown above:,,[]
This signals to the Java compiler that the MyInterfaceImpl class implements the MyInterface interface.,"['implementation: (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (myinterfaceimpl, implements, myinterface)""]"
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.,,[]
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,,[]
Once a Java class implements an Java interface you can use an instance of that class as an instance of that interface.,,[]
Java allows this because the class MyInterfaceImpl implements the MyInterface interface.,,[]
You can then reference instances of the MyInterfaceImpl class as instances of the MyInterface interface.,,[]
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",,[]
In that case the class must implement all the methods declared in all the interfaces implemented.,,[]
"If the interfaces are not located in the same packages as the implementing class, you will also need to import the interfaces.",,[]
Java interfaces are imported using the import instruction just like Java classes.,,[]
Here are the two Java interfaces implemented by the class above:,,[]
"If a Java class implements multiple Java interfaces, there is a risk that some of these interfaces may contain methods with the same signature (name + parameters).",,[]
"Since a Java class can only implement at method with a given signature once, this could potentially lead to some problems.",,[]
"Especially if those constants are to be used by the classes implementing the interface, e.g.",,[]
It is up to the classes implementing the interface to specify an implementation.,,[]
"If the API just adds the method to the desired interface, all classes that implements the interface must implement that new method.",,[]
That is fine if all implementing classes are located within the API.,,[]
"But if some implementing classes are located in client code of the API (the code that uses the API), then that code breaks.",,[]
Look at this interface and imagine that it is part of e.g.,,[]
"If the developer of the API wants to add one more method to the ResourceLoader interface, then the FileLoader class will be broken when that project upgrades to the new version of the API.","['dependency: (fileloader, relies on, resourceloader)', 'implementation: (fileloader, implements, resourceloader)', 'break: (fileloader, will be broken when resourceloader changes, resourceloader)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (fileloader, relies on, resourceloader)"", ""('class', 'implementation', 'interface'): (fileloader, implements, resourceloader)""]"
"A class can override the implementation of a default method simply by implementing that method explicitly, as is done normally when implementing a Java interface.",,[]
Any implementation in a class takes precedence over interface default method implementations.,,[]
Calling a static method in an interface looks and works just like calling a static method in a class.,,[]
Here is an example of calling the static print() method from the above MyInterface interface:,,[]
"It is possible for a Java interface to inherit from another Java interface, just like classes can inherit from other classes.",,[]
"That then means, that if a class implements MySubInterface, that class has to implement all methods defined in both MySubInterface and MySuperInterface.",,[]
A class implementing an interface which inherits from multiple interfaces must implement all methods from the interface and its superinterfaces.,,[]
"While it is normally possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces even if the interfaces contain methods with the same signature, this is not possible if one or more of these methods are default methods.",,[]
"In other words, if two interfaces contain the same method signature (name + parameters) and one of the interfaces declare this method as a default method, a class cannot automatically implement both interfaces.",,[]
In both of the above situations the Java compiler requires that the class implementing the interface(s) explicitly implements the method which causes the problem.,,[]
That way there is no doubt about which implementation the class will have.,,[]
The implementation in the class takes precedence over any default implementations.,,[]
"Basically, polymorphism means that an instance of an class (an object) can be used as if it were of different types.",,[]
"The classes above are all parts of a model representing different types of vehicles and drivers, with fields and methods.",,[]
That is the responsibility of these classes - to model these entities from real life.,,[]
"Please forget for a while, that implementing this functionality as methods directly on the objects may lead to a messy class hierarchy.",,[]
"Where in the above diagram would you put these three methods, so they are accessible on all classes?",,[]
"One way to solve this problem would be to create a common superclass for the Vehicle and Driver class, which has the storage and serialization methods.",,[]
"The class hierarchy would no longer model vehicles and drivers, but also be tied to the storage and serialization mechanisms used in your application.",,[]
"A better solution would be to create some interfaces with the storage and serialization methods on, and let the classes implement these interfaces.",,[]
"When each class implements these two interfaces and their methods, you can access the methods of these interfaces by casting the objects to instances of the interface types.",,[]
"You don't need to know exactly what class a given object is of, as long as you know what interface it implements.",,[]
"As you can probably imagine by now, interfaces provide a cleaner way of implementing cross cutting functionality in classes than inheritance.",,[]
A generic Java interface is an interface which can be typed - meaning it can be specialized to work with a specific type (e.g.,,[]
This interface represents an interface which contains a single method called produce() which can produce a single object.,,[]
"Since the return value of produce() is Object, it can return any Java object.",,[]
The implementation of the produce() method returns a new Car object every time it is called.,,[]
"Notice how the object returned from the carProducer.produce() method call has to be cast to a Car instance, because the produce() method return type is Object.",,[]
"Now when I implement the MyProducer interface in the CarProducer class, I have to include the generic type declaration too, like this:",,[]
"As you can see, since the generic type for the CarProducer instance is set to Car, it is no longer necessary to cast the object returned from the produce() method, since the original method declaration in the MyProducer interface states, that this method returns the same type as is specified in the generic type when used.",,[]
But - now it is actually possible to specify another generic type for a CarProducer instance than the type it actually returns from it's produce() method implementation.,,[]
"If you scroll up, you can see that the CarProducer.produce() implementation returns a Car object no matter what generic type you specify for it when you create it.",,[]
"Instead, you can lock down the generic type of the MyProducer interface already when you implement it, in the CarProducer class.",,[]
"As you can see, it is still not necessary to cast the object returned by produce(), as the CarProducer implementation declares that to be a Car instance.",,[]
A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class.,,[]
Imagine you have a class called StateOwner which can register state event listeners.,,[]
The lambda expression is matched against the parameter type of the addStateListener() method's parameter.,,[]
"For instance, the interface type of the parameter can be inferred from the method declaration of the addStateListener() method (the single method on the StateChangeListener interface).","['dependency: (addstatelistener(), relies on, statechangelistener)', 'reference: (addstatelistener(), parameter type inferred from, statechangelistener)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (addstatelistener(), relies on, statechangelistener)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'interface'): (addstatelistener(), parameter type inferred from, statechangelistener)""]"
"In the example above, the compiler can infer their type from the onStateChange() method declaration.",,[]
"Thus, the type of the parameters oldState and newState are inferred from the method declaration of the onStateChange() method.",,[]
"In this case, these parameters have to match the parameters of the onStateChange() method of the StateChangeListener interface:","['dependency: (onstatechange(), method of, statechangelistener)', 'reference: (onstatechange(), parameters of, statechangelistener)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (onstatechange(), method of, statechangelistener)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'interface'): (onstatechange(), parameters of, statechangelistener)""]"
Here is an example class that creates a lambda which references a static variable from inside the lambda body:,,[]
The class primarily serves to show you that a lambda can access static variables.,,[]
"Since all the lambda body does is forward the string parameter to the System.out.println() method, we can replace the above lambda declaration with a method reference.",,[]
Whatever class or object that owns the referenced method comes before the double colons.,,[]
"Since the parameters of the Finder.find() and MyClass.doFind() methods match, it is possible to create a lambda expression that implements Finder.find() and references the MyClass.doFind() method.","['reference: (finder.find, references, myclass.dofind)', 'alternative: (finder.find, implements, myclass.dofind)', 'similarity: (finder.find, match, myclass.dofind)']","[""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (finder.find, references, myclass.dofind)"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (finder.find, implements, myclass.dofind)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (finder.find, match, myclass.dofind)""]"
Here is an example of a Java lambda expression that calls String.indexOf() to search:,,[]
The convertToInt() method has the same signature as the deserialize() method of the Deserializer deserialize() method.,"['similarity: (converttoint(), has the same signature as, deserialize())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (converttoint(), has the same signature as, deserialize())""]"
"Because of that, we can create an instance of StringConverter and reference its convertToInt() method from a Java lambda expression, like this:","['reference: (stringconverter, reference its converttoint() method, converttoint)', 'access: (lambda expression, access/reference, converttoint)']",[]
Finally it is possible to reference a constructor of a class.,,[]
"You do that by writing the class name followed by ::new, like this:",,[]
The create() method of this interface matches the signature of one of the constructors in the String class.,"['similarity: (create(), matches the signature of one of the constructors in, string)', 'reference: (create(), of, string)']","[""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (create(), of, string)""]"
"In Java, all instructions (code) have to be located inside a Java class.",,[]
A class is a way of grouping data and instructions that belong together.,,[]
"Declaring a simple class without any variables, methods or any other instructions, looks like this in Java code:",,[]
This Java code needs to be located in a file with the same file name as the class and ending with the file suffix .java.,,[]
"Once the file is located in a file matching its class name and ending with .java, you can compile it with the Java compiler from the Java SDK, or from inside your Java IDE (which is much easier).",,[]
It is recommended that you locate your class in a Java package.,,[]
"If you locate a Java class inside a Java package, you have to specify the package name at the top of the Java file.",,[]
Here is how the class from earlier looks with a package declaration added:,,[]
Note: The file MyClass.java must now be located in the directory myjavacode and contain the package declaration package myjavacode; .,,[]
A Java program starts by executing the main method of some class.,,[]
"You can choose the name of the class to execute, but not the name of the method.",,[]
Here is how the main method declaration looks when located inside the Java class declaration from earlier:,,[]
Just remember that a main() method declaration needs these three keywords.,,[]
"In the main() method example earlier I called the String array parameter args, and in the second example I called it stringArray.",,[]
"You call the java command that comes with the JRE, and tells it what Java class to execute, and what arguments to pass to the main() method.",,[]
The second and third arguments (-cp classes) tells the JVM in what directory the compiled Java classes are located (cp means class path).,,[]
In this case the compiled Java classes are located in a directory named classes.,,[]
The fourth argument is the name of the Java class the JVM is to execute.,,[]
"Notice how the class name also contains the name of the package the class is located in (the ""fully qualified class name"").",,[]
You can pass arguments from the command line to the main() method.,,[]
"When the JVM executes the main() method of the myjavacode.MyClass, the String array passed as parameter to the main() method will contain two Strings: ""Hello"" and ""World"".","['transfer: (main(), passed as parameter to, string)', 'containment: (string, contain, string)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (main(), passed as parameter to, string)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (string, contain, string)""]"
The main() method can access the arguments from the command line like this:,,[]
"If only a single Java class in your Java program contains a main() method, then the class containing the main() method is often referred to as the main class.",,[]
You can have as many classes as you want in your project with a main() method in.,,[]
You can still call the other main() methods from inside the main() method the Java Virtual Machine executes (you haven't seen how yet) and you can also start up multiple virtual machines which each execute a single main() method.,,[]
Therefore Java also contains the Java Math class which contains methods for performing more advanced math calculations in Java.,,[]
This Java math tutorial will take a closer look at both Java's math operators as well as the Java Math class.,,[]
"The result of this division would be 12.5 , but since the two numbers are integers, the .5 fraction is cut off.",,[]
"Even though the result variable is now a floating point type (double), the final result is still just 12 instead of 12.5 .",,[]
Now the result variable would end up with the value 12.5.,,[]
"The first System.out.println() statement correctly prints the value 0.0 , which is the start value of the the resultDbl3 variable.",,[]
"Adding the value 0.01 to 0 a total of 100 times should result in the value 1.0, right?",,[]
The Java Math class provides more advanced mathematical calculations than what the basic Java math operators provide.,,[]
"The Math class contains methods for finding the maximum or minimum of two values, rounding values, logarithmic functions, square root, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan etc.","['containment: (math, contains, sin)', 'containment: (math, contains, cos)', 'containment: (math, contains, tan)', 'example: (sin, trigonometric functions such as, cos)', 'example: (sin, trigonometric functions such as, tan)', 'example: (cos, trigonometric functions such as, sin)', 'example: (cos, trigonometric functions such as, tan)', 'example: (tan, trigonometric functions such as, sin)', 'example: (tan, trigonometric functions such as, cos)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (math, contains, sin)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (math, contains, cos)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (math, contains, tan)""]"
"The Math is located in the java.lang package, and not in the java.math package.","['alternative: (java.lang, not in, java.math)', 'difference: (java.lang, located in, java.math)']",[]
"Thus, the fully qualified class name of the Math class is java.lang.Math .",,[]
"Since many of the functions of the Math class are independent from each other, each method will be explained in its own section below.",,[]
"The java.lang.Math contains a set of basic math functions for obtaining the absolute value, highest and lowest of two values, rounding of values, random values etc.",,[]
These basic math functions of the Java Math class will be covered in the following sections.,,[]
The Math.abs() function returns the absolute value of the parameter passed to it.,,[]
Which of these methods are called depends on the type of the parameter passed to the Math.abs() method.,,[]
The Math.ceil() function rounds a floating point value up to the nearest integer value.,,[]
After executing this Java code the ceil variable will contain the value 8.0 .,,[]
The Math.floor() function rounds a floating point value down to the nearest integer value.,,[]
After executing this Java code the floor variable will contain the value 7.0 .,,[]
"The Math.floorDiv() method divides one integer (int or long) by another, and rounds the result down to the nearest integer value.",,[]
"The floorDiv() method rounds down to the nearest negative integer, instead of the rounding up that would occur with fraction truncation.",,[]
This shows the difference between the / division operator and Math.floorDiv() .,,[]
The Math.min() method returns the smallest of two values passed to it as parameter.,,[]
The Math.max() method returns the largest of two values passed to it as parameter.,,[]
The Math.round() method rounds a float or double to the nearest integer using normal math round rules (either up or down).,,[]
"After executing these two Java statements the roundedDown variable will contain the value 23.0 , and the roundedUp variable will contain the value 24.0.",,[]
The Math.random() method returns a random floating point number between 0 and 1.,,[]
"100, multiply the value returned by Math.random() with the maximum number (e.g.",,[]
"If you need an integer value, use the round(), floor() or ceil() method.","['alternative: (round(), can be used instead of, floor())', 'alternative: (round(), can be used instead of, ceil())', 'alternative: (floor(), can be used instead of, ceil())', 'alternative: (floor(), can be used instead of, round())', 'alternative: (ceil(), can be used instead of, round())', 'alternative: (ceil(), can be used instead of, floor())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (round(), can be used instead of, floor())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (round(), can be used instead of, ceil())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (floor(), can be used instead of, ceil())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (floor(), can be used instead of, round())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (ceil(), can be used instead of, round())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (ceil(), can be used instead of, floor())""]"
The Java Math class also contains a set of functions intended for exponential and logarithmic calculations.,,[]
The Math.exp() function returns e (Euler's number) raised to the power of the value provided as parameter.,,[]
The Math.log10 method works like the Math.log() method except is uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e (Euler's Number).,"['alternative: (math.log10, uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e, math.log)', 'similarity: (math.log10, works like, math.log)', 'difference: (math.log10, except is uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e, math.log)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (math.log10, uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e, math.log)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (math.log10, works like, math.log)"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (math.log10, except is uses 10 as is base for calculating the logarithm instead of e, math.log)""]"
"In other words, the Math.pow() example calculate the values of 22 and 28 which are 4 and 256.",,[]
The Math.sqrt() method calculates the square root of the parameter given to it.,,[]
"If you are looking for a trigonometric function and you cannot find it here, check the JavaDoc for the Java Math class.",,[]
"The Math class just might have the function you are looking for, even if I have not described it here.",,[]
The Math.PI constant is a double with a value that is very close to the value of PI - the mathematical definition of PI.,,[]
You will often need the Math.PI field when making trigonometric calculations.,,[]
The Math.sin() method calculates the sine value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.cos() method calculates the cosine value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.tan() method calculates the tangens value of some angle value in radians.,,[]
The Math.asin() method calculates the arc sine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.acos() method calculates the arc cosine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.atan() method calculates the arc tangens value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.sinh() method calculates the hyperbolic sine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.cosh() method calculates the hyperbolic cosine value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
The Math.tanh() method calculates the hyperbolic tangens value of a value between 1 and -1.,,[]
Java methods are similar to what is called functions or procedures in other programming languages (e.g.,,[]
The example above defines a method called writeText inside a class named MyClass.,,[]
You can use any primitive data type or built-in Java class as data type for parameters.,,[]
"When the above Java code is executed, the writeText() method will get executed, and the parameters will contain the values ""Hello"" and ""World"".",,[]
"But, instead of returning to where the method was called from, the execution is resumed inside the first catch() { } clause surrounding the method, targeted at that exception.",,[]
"Notice how the method callSum() creates a variable called theSum, and assigns it the value returned by the add(1, 3) method call.","['dependency: (callsum, assigns the value returned by, add)', 'implementation: (callsum, calls, add)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (callsum, assigns the value returned by, add)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (callsum, calls, add)""]"
Before Java 9 and the Java Platform Module System you would have had to package all of the Java Platform APIs with your Java application because there was no official way of reliably checking what classes your Java application used.,"['dependency: (java application, package, java platform apis)', 'check: (java application, checking, java platform apis)', 'access: (java application, used, java platform apis)']",[]
"Since the Java Platform APIs have grown quite large over the years, your application would get a large amount of Java classes included in its distribution, many of which your application would probably not be using.",,[]
The unused classes makes your application distributable bigger than it needs to be.,,[]
from a missing JAR file) would not be detected until the application actually tried to use the missing class.,,[]
This would happen sometime at runtime - depending on when the application tried to use the missing class.,,[]
Having missing modules reported at application startup time is a big advantage compared to at runtime when trying to use the missing module / JAR / class.,,[]
"However, you should not use underscores (_) in module names (or package names, class names, method names, variable names etc.)",,[]
"Before Java 9 all Java classes for an application or API were nested directly inside a root class directory (which was added to the classpath), or directly inside a JAR file.","['containment: (java, nested inside, jar)', 'alternative: (java, inside, jar)', 'containment: (java, added to, jar)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java, nested inside, jar)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java, inside, jar)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java, added to, jar)""]"
The module root directory is used both for the source files and compiled classes of a Java module.,,[]
Each Java module needs a Java module descriptor named module-info.java which has to be located in the corresponding module root directory.,,[]
Notice also how the module descriptor is suffixed .java and yet it uses a hyphen in the file name (module-info.java).,,[]
"Hyphens are not normally allowed in Java class names, but in module descriptor file names they are required!",,[]
This example module descriptor declares that it requires the standard Java module named javafx.graphics.,,[]
By split package is meant that the total content (classes) of the package is split between multiple modules.,,[]
"Inside that directory you will find a directory with the name of the module, and inside that directory you will find the compiled classes plus a compiled version of the module-info.java module descriptor named module-info.class.",,[]
"In order to run the main class of a Java module you use the java command, like this:",,[]
The --module argument tells what module + main class to run.,,[]
Notice how the module name and main class name are separated by a slash (/) character.,,[]
You can still set the JAR main class when generating the module JAR file.,,[]
Here is an example of setting the main class of a Java module JAR file:,,[]
You can now run the main class of this JAR file with a shortcut.,,[]
Here is how you run the main class from a Java module JAR file:,,[]
"If the Java module JAR file has a main class set (see a few sections earlier in this tutorial for how to do that), you can run the Java module main class with a little shorter command line.",,[]
Here is an example of running a Java module from a JAR file with a main class set:,,[]
The --module argument specifies which module plus main class to run.,,[]
"From Java 9 and forward, all Java classes must be located in a module for the Java VM to use them.",,[]
"But what do you do with older Java libraries where you just have the compiled classes, or a JAR file?",,[]
In Java 9 you can still use the -classpath argument to the Java VM when running an application.,,[]
"On the classpath you can include all your older Java classes, just like you have done before Java 9.",,[]
All classes found on the classpath will be included in what Java calls the unnamed module.,,[]
"However, the classes in the unnamed module are only readable by other classes in the unnamed module - or from automatic modules (see next section).",,[]
No named module can read the classes of the unnamed module.,,[]
All classes in the unnamed module requires all modules found on the module path.,,[]
"That way, all classes in the unnamed module can read all classes exported by all the Java modules found on the module path.",,[]
"While you can include the third party library on the classpath and thus include it in the unnamed module, your own named modules cannot use it, because named modules cannot read classes from the unnamed module.",,[]
"An automatic module is made from a JAR file with Java classes that are not modularized, meaning the JAR file has no module descriptor.",,[]
When you place an ordinary JAR file on the module path (not the classpath) the Java VM will convert it to an automatic module at runtime.,,[]
"If your application contains multiple automatic modules, each automatic module can read the classes of all other automatic modules.",,[]
This is different from explicitly named modules (real Java modules) which cannot read classes in the unnamed module.,,[]
"An automatic module exports all its packages, so all named modules on the module path can use the classes of an automatic module.",,[]
"If a JAR file contains versioning in its file name, e.g.",,[]
"The service interface is typically located in a service interface Java module which only contains the service interface, plus any classes and interfaces related to the service interface.",,[]
The com folder at the root level of the JAR file contains the compiled Java classes for pre Java 9 versions.,,[]
Earlier versions of Java do not understand multi Java version JAR files so they use the classes found here.,,[]
The META-INF directory contains the MANIFEST.MF file and a directory named versions.,,[]
The MANIFEST.MF file needs a special entry that marks the JAR file as a multi version JAR file.,,[]
The versions directory which can contain the compiled classes for different versions of Java for your module.,,[]
"Upgrading utility libraries first to automatic modules, and later to full modules, starting at the bottom of the dependency hierarchy should assure that your libraries can still read each other during upgrade, plus be readable by the main applications on the classpath in the unnamed module or as an automatic or named module.",,[]
In Java nested classes are classes that are defined inside another class.,,[]
"The purpose of a nested class is to clearly group the nested class with its surrounding class, signaling that these two classes are to be used together.",,[]
Or perhaps that the nested class is only to be used from inside its enclosing (owning) class.,,[]
"Java developers often refer to nested classes as inner classes, but inner classes (non-static nested classes) are only one out of several different types of nested classes in Java.",,[]
In Java nested classes are considered members of their enclosing class.,,[]
"Thus, a nested class can be declared public, package (no access modifier), protected and private (see access modifiers for more info).",,[]
Therefore nested classes in Java can also be inherited by subclasses as explained in my tutorial about Java inheritance.,,[]
You can create several different types of nested classes in Java.,,[]
All these types of nested classes will be covered in the following sections.,,[]
"In order to create an instance of the Nested class you must reference it by prefixing it with the Outer class name, like this:",,[]
In Java a static nested class is essentially a normal class that has just been nested inside another class.,,[]
"Being static, a static nested class can only access instance variables of the enclosing class via a reference to an instance of the enclosing class.",,[]
Inner classes are associated with an instance of the enclosing class.,,[]
"Thus, you must first create an instance of the enclosing class to create an instance of an inner class.",,[]
Here is how you create an instance of the Inner class:,,[]
Notice how you put new after the reference to the outer class in order to create an instance of the inner class.,,[]
"Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to the fields of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.",,[]
Notice how the printText() method of the Inner class references the private text field of the Outer class.,,[]
"If a Java inner class declares fields or methods with the same names as field or methods in its enclosing class, the inner fields or methods are said to shadow over the outer fields or methods.",,[]
In the above example both the Outer and Inner class contains a field named text.,,[]
When the Inner class refers to text it refers to its own field.,,[]
"Java makes it possible though, for the Inner class to refer to the text field of the Outer class.",,[]
To do so it has to prefix the text field reference with Outer.this.,,[]
Now the Inner.printText() method will print both the Inner.text and Outer.text fields.,,[]
Local classes in Java are like inner classes (non-static nested classes) that are defined inside a method or scope block ({ ... }) inside a method.,,[]
Local classes can only be accessed from inside the method or scope block in which they are defined.,,[]
Local classes can access members (fields and methods) of its enclosing class just like regular inner classes.,,[]
"Local classes can also access local variables inside the same method or scope block, provided these variables are declared final.",,[]
From Java 8 local classes can also access local variables and parameters of the method the local class is declared in.,,[]
In that case the local class only has access to the static parts of the enclosing class.,,[]
"Local classes cannot contain all kinds of static declarations (constants are allowed - variables declared static final), because local classes are non-static in nature - even if declared inside a static method.",,[]
The same shadowing rules apply for local classes as for inner classes.,,[]
Anonymous classes in Java are nested classes without a class name.,,[]
"They are typically declared as either subclasses of an existing class, or as implementations of some interface.",,[]
Here is an example that declares an anonymous subclass of a superclass called SuperClass:,,[]
Running this Java code would result in Anonymous class doIt() being printed to System.out.,"['transfer: (doit(), printed to, system.out)', 'implementation: (doit(), being printed to, system.out)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (doit(), printed to, system.out)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (doit(), being printed to, system.out)""]"
The anonymous class subclasses (extends) SuperClass and overrides the doIt() method.,,[]
A Java anonymous class can also implement an interface instead of extending a class.,,[]
"As you can see, an anonymous class implementing an interface is pretty similar to an anonymous class extending another class.",,[]
"You can declare fields and methods inside an anonymous class, but you cannot declare a constructor.",,[]
"You can declare a static initializer for the anonymous class instead, though.",,[]
The same shadowing rules apply to anonymous classes as to inner classes.,,[]
The benefits of Java nested classes are that you can group classes together that belong together.,,[]
"You could do so already by putting them in the same package, but putting one class inside another makes an even stronger grouping.",,[]
A nested class is typically only used by or with its enclosing class.,,[]
"Sometimes a nested class is only visible to the enclosing class, is only used internally, and is thus never visible outside the enclosing class.",,[]
"Other times the nested class is visible outside its enclosing class, but can only be used in conjunction with the enclosing class.",,[]
"Inside the Cache class you might declare a CacheEntry class which can contain information about a specific cache entry (cached value, time inserted, number of times accessed etc.).","['containment: (cache, contain, cacheentry)', 'creation: (cache, declare, cacheentry)', 'access: (cache, accessed, cacheentry)', 'reference: (cache, about, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, contain, cacheentry)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (cache, declare, cacheentry)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (cache, about, cacheentry)""]"
"Users of the Cache class may never see the CacheEntry class, if they have no need to obtain information about the CacheEntry itself, but only the cached value.","['access: (cache, obtain information about, cacheentry)', 'dependency: (cache, relies on, cacheentry)', 'reference: (cache, points to, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (cache, relies on, cacheentry)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (cache, points to, cacheentry)""]"
"However, the Cache class may choose to make the CacheEntry class visible to the outside world, so they can access more than just the cached value (for instance information about when the value was last refreshed etc.","['access: (cache, access more than just the cached value, cacheentry)', 'containment: (cache, make the cacheentry class visible to the outside world, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, make the cacheentry class visible to the outside world, cacheentry)""]"
The first Cache class hides its CacheEntry nested class while the second Cache class exposes it.,"['containment: (cache, hides, cacheentry)', 'containment: (cache, exposes, cacheentry)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, hides, cacheentry)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (cache, exposes, cacheentry)""]"
You instantiate an object of a certain class using the new keyword.,,[]
"This example declares a variable of the MyClass class (custom data type), and then creates a new MyClass instance and assigns a reference to this instance to myClassInstance variable.",,[]
"Inside the parantheses () after the for keyword, are three statements separated by semicolon (;).",,[]
"Here is a simple example of a class that has two methods, where one method calls the other:",,[]
"Notice how printBoth() calls the print() method two times, each time with a different of the parameters passed to the printBoth() method.","['dependency: (printboth(), calls, print())', 'implementation: (printboth(), calls, print())', 'reference: (printboth(), calls, print())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (printboth(), calls, print())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (printboth(), calls, print())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (printboth(), calls, print())""]"
The print() method is thus a reusable block of code that can be called from anywhere.,,[]
"When the print() method is finished executing, the program jumps back to after the line that called the print() method.",,[]
"Java packages are a mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the same ""group"" (package).",,[]
"When a Java project grows bigger, for instance an app or API, it is useful to split the code into multiple Java classes, and the classes into multiple Java packages.",,[]
"When you divide classes into multiple Java packages, it becomes easier to figure out where a certain class you are looking for is.",,[]
All Java source and class files of classes belonging to the same package are located in the same directory.,,[]
"Its a tree of packages, subpackages and classes inside these classes.",,[]
"I have expanded two of the sublevel Java packages, so you can see the classes inside.",,[]
"The classes are illustrated using a little blue circle with a C inside, in the screenshot above.",,[]
"Similarly, the fully qualified name of a Java class includes its package name.",,[]
"For instance, the full qualified name of the ""Page"" class, is:",,[]
"In order to put add Java classes to packages, you must do two things:",,[]
Put the class files into the directory matching the package you want to add it to.,,[]
"When you have put your Java source file into the correct directory (matching the package the class should belong to), you have to declare inside that class file, that it belongs to that Java package.",,[]
"Not like Java classes, where the first letter is usually a capital letter.",,[]
"If the classes A and B are located in the same Java package, there is no problem with the code above.",,[]
"If you need to use a lot of classes from a certain Java package, importing them one at a time results in a lot of import statements.",,[]
It is possible to import all classes of a package using the * character instead of a class name.,,[]
It is possible to use a class from another package without importing it with an import statement.,,[]
You can write the fully qualified class name instead of just the name of the class itself.,,[]
"The fully qualified class name consists of the full package path down to the subclass containing the class, and also including the class name itself.",,[]
The fully qualified class name is also what you would write in an import statement.,,[]
"You could use this fully qualified class name to reference the TimeUtil class inside another class, like this:",,[]
"You might be wondering how you decide on what Java packages to create, and how to divide your classes into these packages.","['containment: (java.lang.package, divide … into, java.lang.class)', 'creation: (java.lang.package, create, java.lang.package)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.lang.package, divide … into, java.lang.class)""]"
"The first method is to divide classes after what ""layer"" of the application they belong to.",,[]
All classes involved in communication with the database would then be located in the database package.,,[]
The second method is to divide your classes based on what part of the application functionality they belong to.,,[]
"All classes involved in one way or another in the pension calculations would go into that package (or subpackages, if the number of classes in pension grow large).",,[]
"The ""divide by application functionality"" method of dividing classes into Java packages tends to work better than ""divide by layer"", as your application grows in number of classes.",,[]
"Instead of having a fixed number of layer packages which keep growing in number of classes, you get a growing number of application functionality packages with a smaller number of classes inside.",,[]
"These packages contain classes for all kinds of purposes that programmers often need, like reading and writing files from the local hard disk, sending and receiving data over networks and the internet, connecting to databases, and many, many other things.",,[]
"When you compile all the source code in the source, the compiler produces one .class file for each .java file.",,[]
It is the .class files that the Java Virtual Machine can execute.,,[]
Therefore it is normal to separate the .java files from the .class files.,,[]
This is normally done by instructing the compiler to write the .class files into a separate directory.,,[]
"This directory is often called classes, but again, it is not a requirement, and it depends on what build tool or IDE etc.",,[]
The *.java means the compiler should compile all files in the given directory.,,[]
"Once the compiler has done its job, the classes directory will contain the compiled .class files.",,[]
The package structure (directory structure) from the source directory will be preserved under the class directory.,,[]
You can run any one of these .class files which have a main() method in it.,,[]
"You can run the .class from inside your Java IDE, or from the command line.",,[]
The -cp classes flag tells the Java Virtual Machine that all your classes are located under the directory called classes.,,[]
The name of the class to run is the last argument in the above command - the myfirstapp.MyJavaApp part.,,[]
The JVM needs to know the fully qualified class name (all packages plus class name) to determine where the corresponding .class file is located.,,[]
When you run the the class your command line will look similar to this (including the output from the Java app):,,[]
A Java Record is a special kind of Java class which has a concise syntax for defining immutable data-only classes.,,[]
A Java Record consist of one or more data fields which corresponds to member variables in a regular Java class.,,[]
"The Java compiler auto generates getter methods, toString(), hashcode() and equals() methods for these data fields, so you don't have to write that boilerplate code yourself.","['similarity: (tostring(), and, hashcode())', 'similarity: (tostring(), and, equals())', 'similarity: (hashcode(), and, equals())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (tostring(), and, hashcode())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (tostring(), and, equals())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (hashcode(), and, equals())""]"
"The Java compiler then generates the corresponding fields, getter methods and a hashCode() and equals() method.","['similarity: (hashcode(), and, equals())', 'alternative: (hashcode(), and, equals())', 'dependency: (hashcode(), then generates, equals())', 'creation: (java compiler, generates, hashcode())', 'creation: (java compiler, generates, equals())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (hashcode(), and, equals())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (hashcode(), and, equals())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (hashcode(), then generates, equals())""]"
You use a Java Record just like you use other Java classes - by creating instances of the record type using the Java new keyword.,,[]
"Notice how the Java compiler has generated a brand() method, a licensePlate() method and a toString() method for us.","['example: (brand(), generated alongside, licenseplate())', 'example: (brand(), generated alongside, tostring())', 'example: (licenseplate(), generated alongside, tostring())']",[]
"A Record type definition is final, meaning you cannot create subclasses (subrecords) of a Java Record type.",,[]
You can add instance methods to a Java Record definition - just like you can with a regular Java class.,,[]
Here is an example of the Vehicle Java Record definition from earlier sections with an instance method named brandAsLowerCase() added:,,[]
Notice how the brandAsLowerCase() method calls the auto-generated brand() method internally.,"['dependency: (brandaslowercase(), calls, brand())', 'reference: (brandaslowercase(), internally, brand())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (brandaslowercase(), calls, brand())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (brandaslowercase(), internally, brand())""]"
"That means, that even classes from different projects compiled separately, but which are used in the same application may share constant String objects.",,[]
"As you can see, a new StringBuilder is created, passing along the first String to its constructor, and the second String to its append() method, before finally calling the toString() method.","['dependency: (stringbuilder, calls, append())', 'dependency: (stringbuilder, calls, tostring())', 'implementation: (append(), chained with, tostring())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stringbuilder, calls, append())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (stringbuilder, calls, tostring())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (append(), chained with, tostring())""]"
This code actually creates two objects: A StringBuilder instance and a new String instance returned from the toString() method.,"['conversion: (stringbuilder, returned from, tostring())', 'creation: (tostring(), creates a new string instance, string)', 'dependency: (string, returned from, tostring())', 'access: (stringbuilder, uses, tostring())']",[]
"The bigger the result String grows, the longer it takes to copy the characters from it into a new StringBuilder, and again copy the characters from the StringBuilder into the temporary String created by the toString() method.","['transfer: (string, copy the characters from it into, stringbuilder)', 'transfer: (stringbuilder, copy the characters from, string)', 'conversion: (stringbuilder, tostring() method, string)']",[]
You can obtain the length of a String using the length() method.,,[]
You do so using the substring() method of the String class.,"['dependency: (substring(), method of, string)', 'access: (substring(), uses, string)', 'containment: (string, has, substring())']",[]
The last character in the string has has the index String.length() - 1.,,[]
You can search for substrings in Strings using the indexOf() method.,,[]
The indexOf() method returns the index of where the first character in the first matching substring is found.,,[]
"If the substring is not found within the string, the indexOf() method returns -1;",,[]
There is a version of the indexOf() method that takes an index from which the search is to start.,,[]
The Java String class also has a lastIndexOf() method which finds the last occurrence of a substring.,,[]
"The Java String matches() method takes a regular expression as parameter, and returns true if the regular expression matches the string, and false if not.",,[]
The equals() method tests if two Strings are exactly equal to each other.,,[]
The String class also has a method called equalsIgnoreCase() which compares two strings but ignores the case of the characters.,"['access: (string, has a method called, equalsignorecase)', 'implementation: (equalsignorecase, compares, string)', 'difference: (equalsignorecase, ignores the case of the characters, string)']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (equalsignorecase, compares, string)""]"
The startsWith() and endsWith() methods check if the String starts with a certain substring.,"['alternative: (startswith(), can be used instead of, endswith())', 'similarity: (startswith(), and, endswith())', 'check: (startswith(), check if the string starts with a certain substring, endswith())', 'check: (endswith(), check if the string starts with a certain substring, startswith())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (startswith(), can be used instead of, endswith())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (startswith(), and, endswith())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (startswith(), check if the string starts with a certain substring, endswith())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (endswith(), check if the string starts with a certain substring, startswith())""]"
"The compareTo() method compares the String to another String and returns an int telling whether this String is smaller, equal to or larger than the other String.",,[]
"If the String is earlier in sorting order than the other String, compareTo() returns a negative number.",,[]
"If the String is equal in sorting order to the other String, compareTo() returns 0.",,[]
"If the String is after the other String in sorting order, the compareTo() metod returns a positive number.",,[]
You should be aware that the compareTo() method may not work correctly for Strings in different languages than English.,,[]
The Java String class contains a method called trim() which can trim a string object.,"['modification: (trim(), can trim, string)']",[]
The trim() method can be very useful to trim text typed into input fields by a user.,,[]
The trim() method is an easy way to remove such extra white space characters.,,[]
The Java String class contains a method named replace() which can replace characters in a String.,"['modification: (replace(), replaces characters in, string)', 'containment: (string, contains, replace())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, contains, replace())""]"
The replace() method does not actually replace characters in the existing String.,,[]
"The replace() method will replace all character matching the character passed as first parameter to the method, with the second character passed as parameter to the replace() method.",,[]
The Java String replaceFirst() method returns a new String with the first match of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter.,,[]
The Java String replaceAll() method returns a new String with all matches of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter.,"['replacement: (replaceall, returns a new string with all matches of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter, string)', 'conversion: (replaceall, returns a new string with all matches of the regular expression passed as first parameter with the string value of the second parameter, string)', 'immutability: (replaceall, returns a new string, string)', 'creation: (replaceall, returns a new string, string)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (replaceall, returns a new string, string)""]"
The Java String class contains a split() method which can be used to split a String into an array of String objects.,"['containment: (string, contains, split())', 'access: (split(), can be used to split, string)', 'conversion: (split(), split a string into an array of string objects, string)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (string, contains, split())"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (split(), can be used to split, string)""]"
The parameter passed to the split() method is actually a Java regular expression.,,[]
The String split() method exists in a version that takes a limit as a second parameter.,,[]
Here is a Java String split() example using the limit parameter:,,[]
The Java String class contains a set of overloaded static methods named valueOf() which can be used to convert a number to a String.,"['conversion: (valueof(), converts a number to, string)']",[]
"Since all Java classes extends (inherits from) the Object class, all objects have a toString() method.",,[]
"Note: For the toString() method to return a sane String representation of the given object, the class of the object must have overridden the toString() method.","['dependency: (tostring(), must have overridden, tostring())', 'check: (tostring(), to return a sane string representation, tostring())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (tostring(), must have overridden, tostring())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (tostring(), to return a sane string representation, tostring())""]"
"If not, the default toString() method (inherited from the Object class) will get called.","['dependency: (tostring(), inherited from, object)', 'access: (tostring(), called, object)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (tostring(), inherited from, object)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (tostring(), called, object)""]"
The default toString() method does not provide that much useful information.,,[]
It is possible to get a character at a certain index in a String using the charAt() method.,,[]
You can also get the byte representation of the String method using the getBytes() method.,,[]
The first getBytes() call return a byte representation of the String using the default character set encoding on the machine.,,[]
The second getBytes() call return a UTF-8 byte representation of the String.,,[]
You can convert Strings to uppercase and lowercase using the methods toUpperCase() and toLowerCase().,"['alternative: (touppercase(), can be used instead of, tolowercase())', 'conversion: (strings, convert to, touppercase())', 'conversion: (strings, convert to, tolowercase())']",[]
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method named formatted() which can be used to return a formatted version of the String formatted() is called on.,,[]
"The formatted() method is only a preview feature that was added together with Java Text Blocks in Java 13, so we do not yet know if it will stay in.",,[]
Here is an example of using the Java String formatted() method:,,[]
The parameter values passed to formatted() will be inserted into the returned String at the %s location of the input String.,,[]
"From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method named stripIndent() which can be used to strip out indentation, similarly to how indentation is stripped out of Java Text Blocks.",,[]
"The stripIndent() method is a preview feature, so we don't know if it will stay in Java yet.",,[]
Here is an example of using the new Java String stripIndent() method:,,[]
From Java 13 the Java String class got a new method called translateEscapes() which can translate escape codes that exist inside a String in the same way the Java compiler translates them.,"['reference: (string, got a new method called, translateescapes())', 'implementation: (string, has a method, translateescapes())']","[""('class', 'implementation', 'method'): (string, has a method, translateescapes())""]"
"For now, the translateEscapes() is a preview feature, so it is not yet sure that it will stay in Java.",,[]
Here is an example of using the Java String translateEscapes() method:,,[]
When calling the translateEscapes() method the \n part of the text will now be interpreted as a line break escape code.,,[]
The String class has several other useful methods than the ones described in this tutorial.,,[]
"The result of this is, that execution just ""falls through"" to the operation of the next case statement ( and the next etc.)",,[]
All Java code must reside inside a file with the extension .java .,,[]
"Below is an example .java file that contains all of the above elements, so you can see the basic syntax of a .java file:",,[]
The .java file should be located in a directory structure that matches the package name.,,[]
"Please note, that the code example does not actually use the Java HashMap class anywhere.",,[]
Of course you should not import classes you do not use in a real project.,,[]
"In Java a type is either a class, an abstract class an interface, an enum or an annotation.",,[]
A type (class / interface / enum) can have more than one field.,,[]
The fifth line (or block of lines) is a class initializer block.,,[]
Inside this block you can put initialization code that is to be executed a instance of the class is created.,,[]
"Then they are executed already when the class is loaded, and only once because the class is only loaded in the Java Virtual Machine once.",,[]
"Constructors are similar to class initializers, except they can take parameters.",,[]
"A class can have more than one constructor, although this example just shows one.",,[]
When you create an instance of a class (an object) the object can have methods you can execute.,,[]
"A static method belongs to the class, not objects of the class.",,[]
That means that you can call a static method without having an object of the class the static method belongs to.,,[]
"In the example above, if case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to true then the ternary operator expression as a whole returns the String value JOHN.",,[]
"If case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to false then the ternary operator expression as a whole returns the String value john.",,[]
"That means, that the String variable name will end up having the value JOHN or john depending on whether the expression case.equals(""uppercase"") evaluates to true or false.",,[]
"As you can see, both of these code examples avoid calling object.getValue() if the object reference is null, but the first code example is a bit shorter and more elegant.",,[]
You can achieve the same functionality as the Java Math max() function using a Java ternary operator.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.max() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
The Java ternary operator can also be used to achieve the same effect as the Java Math min() function.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.min() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
The Java ternary operator can also be used to achieve the same effect as the Java Math abs() function.,,[]
Here is an example of achieving the Math.abs() functionality using a Java ternary operator:,,[]
"If the input String is not equal to the empty String, the second ternary operator returns the value of Integer.parseInt(input) .","['check: (integer.parseint, if not empty string, string.equals)', 'dependency: (integer.parseint, depends on, string.equals)']","[""('method', 'check', 'method'): (integer.parseint, if not empty string, string.equals)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (integer.parseint, depends on, string.equals)""]"
"This can be any kind of information ranging from texts, codes (e.g.",,[]
"In the code example below, the main() method contains the declaration of a single integer variable named number.",,[]
"Non-static fields are also called instance variables, because they belong to instances (objects) of a class.",,[]
A static field is a variable that belongs to a class.,,[]
The second line assigns the floating point value 199.99 to the floating point variable named myFloat.,,[]
"In this example, only the first System.out.println() statement is executed inside the while loop.",,[]
The second System.out.println() statement is not executed until after the while loop is finished.,,[]
"This is typically done via a command line interface (CLI), like e.g.",,[]
On the command line you tell the JVM what Java class (bytecode) to execute.,,[]
Only the full Java SDK contains the Java compiler which turns your .java source files into byte code .class files.,,[]
"Additionally, some Java servers may need some of the tools in the JDK to e.g.",,[]
"The Java Code Conventions are a set of conventions for how to format your Java code, and how to name classes, variables, files etc.",,[]
JavaFX was inspired by Flex (Flash) and Silverlight for .NET (Microsoft).,,[]
In this tutorial I will show you how to make your first Java app with IntelliJ IDEA community edition (free) version 2019.3.3.,,[]
"How you do that depends on what operating system you are running (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.)",,[]
"A Java package is just a directory inside which you can put one or more Java files (class, interface, annotation, enum etc.",,[]
Now you must create a new class inside your newly created package.,,[]
"In the dialog that opens, type in a name for your new Java class.",,[]
"It is custom to have class names start with an uppercase character followed by lowercase characters, and a new uppercase character for each new word in the class name.",,[]
"When you have typed in a name for your new Java class, click the ""OK"" button.",,[]
"Once you have created the new class, it will be empty.",,[]
The part inside the /* ... */ are comments and are not part of the executed Java code.,,[]
Before you can run your Java app you need to insert a main() method into the class.,,[]
Now your are ready to run your newly created Java class.,,[]
"You do so by right clicking the class source code in the editor, and choose ""Run..."", like this:",,[]
"When you click the ""Run..."" option, IntelliJ IDEA will first compile your Java class, and then run it.",,[]
"After you have executed the Java class main method, you will see an output at the bottom of the IntelliJ IDEA window similar to this:",,[]
"Don't worry if you don't yet understand what a main() method is, or classes, or packages.",,[]
The most common way of using the Java Logging API is to create a Logger in each class that needs to log.,,[]
"This instance is typically made static and final, meaning all instances of that class use the same Logger instance.",,[]
"As you can see from this example, it is common practice to use the class name including package name as name for the Logger.",,[]
The name of the Logger to create is passed as string parameter to the Logger.getLogger() method.,,[]
"For instance, ordinary debug trace logging calls to entering() and exiting() would be called at the beginning and end of a method call.","['dependency: (entering(), called at the beginning of a method call, exiting())', 'dependency: (exiting(), called at the end of a method call, entering())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (entering(), called at the beginning of a method call, exiting())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (exiting(), called at the end of a method call, entering())""]"
The initialization of the configuration is taken care of by the java.util.logging.LogManager class.,,[]
You can use a Java class to configure the Java Logging API.,"['dependency: (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.handler)', 'dependency: (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.level)', 'dependency: (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.filter)', 'dependency: (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.formatter)', 'dependency: (java.util.logging.logger, configures, java.util.logging.logmanager)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.handler)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.level)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.filter)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, uses, java.util.logging.formatter)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, configures, java.util.logging.logmanager)""]"
You do so by specifying the name of the class in the JVM parameter java.util.logging.config.class.,,[]
It is the constructor of that class that should load the configuration and apply it to the Logger's in the hierarchy.,,[]
"If no configuration class is specified, you can instead specify a configuration file (but no configuration class can be specified then!",,[]
"The Java Logging API has a default logging configuration file located at ""lib/logging.properties"", inside the JRE directory.","['containment: (java.util.logging.logger, has default logging configuration file located at lib/logging.properties inside, java.util.logging.logmanager)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logger, has default logging configuration file located at lib/logging.properties inside, java.util.logging.logmanager)""]"
You do so by setting the JVM property java.util.logging.config.file to point to this file.,,[]
You should double check the JavaDoc over time to see if any of this changes (e.g.,,[]
"If the isLoggable() method returns false, the LogRecord is not logged.",,[]
The Handler's in the Java Logging API use a java.util.logging.Formatter to format the LogRecord's before writing it to an external system.,"['dependency: (java.util.logging.handler, use, java.util.logging.formatter)', 'access: (java.util.logging.formatter, format, java.util.logging.logrecord)', 'transfer: (java.util.logging.handler, writing ... to an external system, java.util.logging.logrecord)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.util.logging.handler, use, java.util.logging.formatter)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (java.util.logging.handler, writing ... to an external system, java.util.logging.logrecord)""]"
"The various Handler's in the Java Logging API use either of these two Formatter's by default, but you can also set your own custom Formatter subclass on a Handler.","['dependency: (handler, use, formatter)', 'access: (handler, set, formatter)', 'alternative: (handler, set your own custom formatter subclass on, formatter)']",[]
You can create your own Formatter by subclassing the java.util.logging.Formatter class.,,[]
The subclass must override the abstract format() method in the Formatter class.,"['dependency: (format(), override ... in, formatter)', 'implementation: (format(), must override ... in, formatter)', 'reference: (format(), in, formatter)', 'containment: (format(), in, formatter)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (format(), override ... in, formatter)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (format(), must override ... in, formatter)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (format(), in, formatter)""]"
The String returned by the format() is what is forwarded to the external system by the Handler.,"['transfer: (format(), returned by, string)', 'transfer: (format(), forwarded to, handler)', 'dependency: (handler, relies on, string)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (format(), returned by, string)"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (format(), forwarded to, handler)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (handler, relies on, string)""]"
The Formatter class also contains the convenience method formatMessage() which can be used to format the message using the ResourceBundle of the LogRecord.,"['containment: (formatter, contains, formatmessage())']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (formatter, contains, formatmessage())""]"
By default the ConsoleHandler uses a SimpleFormatter to format the messages before writing them to System.err.,"['dependency: (consolehandler, uses, simpleformatter)', 'transfer: (consolehandler, writes messages to, system.err)', 'dependency: (simpleformatter, formats messages for, system.err)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (consolehandler, uses, simpleformatter)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (consolehandler, writes messages to, system.err)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (simpleformatter, formats messages for, system.err)""]"
"If no %g code has been specified and the file count of the FileHandler is greater than 1, then the generation number (file sequence number) will be appended to the end of the file name, after a dot (.)",,[]
You must set one using the method setOutputStream() before using the handler.,,[]
You can also call the push() method to force the LogRecord's in the buffer to be flushed to the target Handler.,,[]
This class contains a constant for each of the above log levels.,,[]
When you create a Logger you pass a name to the Logger.getLogger() method.,,[]
(Note: These levels are different from the log levels of the messages logged.).,,[]
If you call getParent() on that Logger you will get the Logger with the name com.,,[]
"... and call getParent() method, you will get the Logger with the name """".",,[]
"The third message is being logged three times: Once by the 1.2 Logger, once by the 1 Logger, and once by the root Logger.",,[]
"Notice though, that the message propagated up the hierarchy from the Logger named 1.2 is still logged by the middle Logger, and still forwarded up to the root Logger.",,[]
"Another peculiar result of the above code is, that the INFO message passed to the bottom Logger (named 1.2) is also ignored, and not propagated.",,[]
"In order to enable all INFO messages to be logged from the bottom Logger (named 1.2), even if the middle Logger has a log level of WARNING, we add the following to the code (in bold):",,[]
"The result of this code is that the INFO message logged on the bottom Logger (named 1.2) is now logged, but it is still not propagated up the hierarchy.",,[]
The java.util.Logger class is the main access point to the Java logging API.,,[]
The string passed as parameter to the getLogger() factory method is the name of the Logger to create.,,[]
"The two names ""myApp.user"" and ""myApp.admin"" are children of the ""myApp"" name.",,[]
"The name ""myApp.admin.import.user"" is a branch of the name ""myApp.admin.import"", which is again a branch of the ""myApp.admin"" name.",,[]
"You can obtain the name of a Logger using the getName() method, in case you need it.",,[]
"It is convention to use the class name of the class creating the Logger, including package name, as name for the Logger.",,[]
The log() group of methods will log a message at a certain log level.,,[]
"As mentioned earlier, the number inside the token refers to the index of the object parameter to insert, in the object parameter array passed to the log() message.",,[]
"The logp() methods work like the log() methods, except each method take an extra two parameters: The sourceClass and sourceMethod parameter.",,[]
These two parameters are intended to tell from what class and method the log message originated.,,[]
"In other words, which class and method was the ""source"" of the log message.",,[]
"The logrb() methods work like the log() methods too, except they can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle.","['alternative: (logrb(), work like, log())', 'access: (logrb(), obtain log messages from, resource bundle)', 'difference: (logrb(), can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle, log())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (logrb(), work like, log())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (logrb(), can obtain the log messages from a resource bundle, log())""]"

Logging message using one of these methods corresponds to calling the log() method,,[]
You can add Handler's to the Logger using the addHandler() method.,,[]
"You can obtain all Handler's of a Logger using the getHandlers() method, like this:",,[]
"You set the Filter on a Logger using the setFilter() method, like this:",,[]
The class MyFilterImpl should be your own implementation of the Filter interface.,,[]
"You can obtain the Filter in use by calling the getFilter() method, like this:",,[]
"This example sets the minimum log level of messages to be forwarded, to Level.INFO.",,[]
You can obtain the log level of a Logger using the getLevel() method:,,[]
You can obtain the parent Logger of a given Logger using the getParent() method.,,[]
You can check if a Logger forwards log messages to its parent Logger using the method getUseParentHandlers().,,[]
The Logger class has a few more methods that I haven't covered here.,,[]
"The java.util.logging.LogManager manages the internal Logger hierarchy, and initiates the configuration of the Logger's, either through the configuration class or configuration file.","['access: (java.util.logging.logmanager, manages, java.util.logging.logger)', 'creation: (java.util.logging.logmanager, initiates the configuration of, java.util.logging.logger)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (java.util.logging.logmanager, initiates the configuration of, java.util.logging.logger)""]"

In this text I will try to give you an overview of the java.util.logging API.,,[]
This tutorial is about Javas built-in logging API in the java.util.logging package.,,[]
"Note: This tutorial does not cover the other popular Java logging API's (Log4J, SLF4J, Apache Commons Logging, LogBack etc.).",,[]

In order to use a java.nio.file.Path instance you must create a Path instance.,,[]
You create a Path instance using a static method in the Paths class (java.nio.file.Paths) named Paths.get().,"['access: (java.nio.file.paths, paths.get(), paths.get())', 'creation: (java.nio.file.paths, create a path instance using paths.get(), paths.get())']",[]
To use the Path interface and the Paths class we must first import them.,"['dependency: (path, use, paths)', 'dependency: (paths, use, path)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'interface'): (paths, use, path)""]"
It is the call to the Paths.get() method that creates the Path instance.,,[]
"The Paths.get() method is a factory method for Path instances, in other words.",,[]
Creating an absolute path is done by calling the Paths.get() factory method with the absolute file as parameter.,,[]
The Java NIO Path class can also be used to work with relative paths.,,[]
The second example creates a Path instance which points to the path (file) d:\data\projects\a-project\myfile.txt .,,[]
If you use the .. code in the middle of a path string it will correspond to changing one directory up at that point in the path string.,,[]
The .. code after the a-project directory changes directory up the the parent directory projects and then the path references down into the another-project directory from there.,,[]
and .. codes also work in combination with the two-string Paths.get() method.,,[]
Here are two Java Paths.get() examples showing simple examples of that:,,[]
There are more ways that the Java NIO Path class can be used to work with relative paths.,,[]
The Java Path method relativize() can create a new Path which represents the second Path relative to the first Path.,"['creation: (relativize(), creates, path)', 'reference: (relativize(), represents, path)', 'access: (relativize(), relative to, path)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (relativize(), creates, path)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (relativize(), represents, path)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (relativize(), relative to, path)""]"
"For instance, with the path /data and /data/subdata/subsubdata/myfile.txt"", the second path can be expressed as /subdata/subsubdata/myfile.txt relative to the first path.",,[]
"If you add the relative path subdata/subsubdata/myfile.txt to the directory path /data, you get the full path /data/subdata/subsubdata/myfile.txt.",,[]
If you you add the relative path ../../.. to the full file path /data/subdata/subsubdata/myfile.txt then you get /data,,[]
The normalize() method of the Path interface can normalize a path.,"['modification: (normalize(), normalize, path)']","[""('method', 'modification', 'interface'): (normalize(), normalize, path)""]"
"and .. codes in the middle of the path string, and resolves what path the path string refers to.",,[]
This Path example first creates a path string with a .. code in the middle.,,[]
"Then the example creates a Path instance from this path string, and prints that Path instance out (actually it prints Path.toString()).","['access: (path, prints, path.tostring)', 'dependency: (path.tostring, derived from, path)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (path.tostring, derived from, path)""]"
"The example then calls normalize() on the created Path instance, which returns a new Path instance.",,[]
"As you can see, the normalized path does not contain the a-project\.. part, as this is redundant.",,[]
"You write to a SinkChannel by calling it's write() method, like this:",,[]
To read from the source channel you call its read() method like this:,,[]
The int returned by the read() method tells how many bytes were read into the buffer.,,[]
"Notice how the buffers are first inserted into an array, then the array passed as parameter to the channel.read() method.",,[]
The read() method then writes data from the channel in the sequence the buffers occur in the array.,,[]
"In other words, if you have a header and a body, and the header is fixed size (e.g.",,[]
"The array of buffers are passed into the write() method, which writes the content of the buffers in the sequence they are encountered in the array.",,[]
"The Java NIO Selector is a component which can examine one or more Java NIO Channel instances, and determine which channels are ready for e.g.","['access: (java.nio.channels.selector, examine, java.nio.channels.channel)', 'check: (java.nio.channels.selector, determine which channels are ready, java.nio.channels.channel)']",[]

"You can also attach an object already while registering the Channel with the Selector, in the register() method.",,[]
Once you have register one or more channels with a Selector you can call one of the select() methods.,"['dependency: (register, can call, select())', 'check: (register, once you have register with a selector, select())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (register, can call, select())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (register, once you have register with a selector, select())""]"
"In other words, if you are interested in channels that are ready for reading, you will receive the channels that are ready for reading from the select() methods.",,[]
select() blocks until at least one channel is ready for the events you registered for.,,[]
select(long timeout) does the same as select() except it blocks for a maximum of timeout milliseconds (the parameter).,,[]
The int returned by the select() methods tells how many channels are ready.,,[]
"That is, how many channels that became ready since last time you called select().",,[]
"If you call select() and it returns 1 because one channel has become ready, and you call select() one more time, and one more channel has become ready, it will return 1 again.",,[]
"If you have done nothing with the first channel that was ready, you now have 2 ready channels, but only one channel had become ready between each select() call.",,[]
"Once you have called one of the select() methods and its return value has indicated that one or more channels are ready, you can access the ready channels via the ""selected key set"", by calling the selectors selectedKeys() method.","['access: (select(), access, selectedkeys())', 'dependency: (selectedkeys(), depends on, select())']","[""('method', 'access', 'method'): (select(), access, selectedkeys())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (selectedkeys(), depends on, select())""]"

It is these keys you can access via the selectedKeySet() method.,,[]

"A thread that has called the select() method which is blocked, can be made to leave the select() method, even if no channels are yet ready.",,[]
This is done by having a different thread call the Selector.wakeup() method on the Selector which the first thread has called select() on.,"['dependency: (selector.wakeup, call ... on, select)', 'implementation: (selector.wakeup, call ... on, select)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (selector.wakeup, call ... on, select)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (selector.wakeup, call ... on, select)""]"

When you are finished with the Selector you call its close() method.,,[]
Listening for incoming connections is done by calling the ServerSocketChannel.accept() method.,,[]
"When the accept() method returns, it returns a SocketChannel with an incoming connection.","['creation: (accept(), returns, socketchannel)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (accept(), returns, socketchannel)""]"
"Since you are typically not interested in listening just for a single connection, you call the accept() inside a while-loop.",,[]
"In non-blocking mode the accept() method returns immediately, and may thus return null, if no incoming connection had arrived.",,[]
You close a SocketChannel after use by calling the SocketChannel.close() method.,"['dependency: (socketchannel, close by calling, socketchannel.close())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (socketchannel, close by calling, socketchannel.close())""]"
To read data from a SocketChannel you call one of the read() methods.,,[]

There is no guarantee of how many bytes the write() method writes to the SocketChannel.,,[]

"To determine whether the connection is established, you can call the finishConnect() method, like this:",,[]
In non-blocking mode the write() method may return without having written anything.,,[]
Therefore you need to call the write() method in a loop.,,[]
In non-blocking mode the read() method may return without having read any data at all.,,[]
"Also, parts of the NIO APIs are actually blocking - e.g.",,[]
"A selector is an object that can monitor multiple channels for events (like: connection opened, data arrived etc.).",,[]
"That means, that when a thread invokes a read() or write(), that thread is blocked until there is some data to read, or the data is fully written.","['alternative: (read(), or, write())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (read(), or, write())""]"
Rather than just read the data byte for byte from e.g.,,[]
"In other words, once the first reader.readLine() method returns, you know for sure that a full line of text has been read.",,[]
"The readLine() blocks until a full line is read, that's why.",,[]
"Similarly, when the second readLine() call returns, you know that this line contains the age etc.",,[]
"The bufferFull() method has to keep track of how much data is read into the buffer, and return either true or false, depending on whether the buffer is full.",,[]
"The bufferFull() method scans through the buffer, but must leave the buffer in the same state as before the bufferFull() method was called.",,[]
"Similarly, if you need to keep a lot of open connections to other computers, e.g.",,[]
"If you have fewer connections with very high bandwidth, sending a lot of data at a time, perhaps a classic IO server implementation might be the best fit.",,[]
Using Java Reflection you can access the annotations attached to Java classes at runtime.,,[]

Working with arrays via Java Reflection is done using the java.lang.reflect.Array class.,,[]
"Do not confuse this class with the java.util.Arrays class in the Java Collections suite, which contains utility methods for sorting arrays, converting them to collections etc.",,[]
Creating arrays via Java Reflection is done using the java.lang.reflect.Array class.,,[]
The first parameter int.class given to the Array.newInstance() method tells what type each element in the array should be of.,"['dependency: (array.newinstance, takes as a parameter, int.class)', 'creation: (array.newinstance, creates an array of, int.class)', 'reference: (array.newinstance, uses, int.class)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (array.newinstance, takes as a parameter, int.class)"", ""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (array.newinstance, creates an array of, int.class)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (array.newinstance, uses, int.class)""]"
"For instance, you can access the primitive int array class object like this:",,[]
The [ on the left means it is the class of an int array I am interested in.,,[]
"Notice the [L to the left of the class name, and the ; to the right.",,[]
"As a side note, you cannot obtain the class object of primitives using Class.forName().",,[]
I usually do something like this to obtain the class name for primitives as well as objects:,,[]
"The solution, or workaround as you might call it, is to create an empty array of the desired type and obtain the class object from that empty array.",,[]
"This presents a single, uniform method to access the array class of arrays of any type.",,[]
"To make sure that the Class object really is an array, you can call the Class.isArray() method to check:",,[]
Once you have obtained the Class object for an array you can access its component type via the Class.getComponentType() method.,"['access: (class, access component type, class.getcomponenttype)']",[]
"For instance, the component type of an int[] array is the int.class Class object.",,[]
The component type of a String[] array is the java.lang.String Class object.,,[]
"This example will print out the text ""java.lang.String"" which is the component type of the String array.",,[]
Inspecting classes is often the first thing you do when using Reflection.,,[]
For a full list you should consult the JavaDoc for java.lang.Class.,,[]
Before you can do any inspection on a class you need to obtain its java.lang.Class object.,,[]
"All types in Java including the primitive types (int, long, float etc.)",,[]
If you know the name of the class at compile time you can obtain a Class object like this:,,[]
"If you don't know the name at compile time, but have the class name as a string at runtime, you can do like this:",,[]
String className = ... //obtain class name as string at runtime Class class = Class.forName(className);,,[]
When using the Class.forName() method you must supply the fully qualified class name.,,[]
The Class.forName() method may throw a ClassNotFoundException if the class cannot be found on the classpath at runtime.,,[]
The fully qualified class name (including package name) is obtained using the getName() method like this:,,[]
"If you want the class name without the pacakge name you can obtain it using the getSimpleName() method, like this:",,[]
You can access the modifiers of a class via the Class object.,,[]
You can check the modifiers using these methods in the class java.lang.reflect.Modifier:,,[]
You can also access information specified for this package in the Manifest file of the JAR file this package is located in on the classpath.,"['containment: (java.lang.package, located in, java.util.jar.manifest)', 'access: (java.lang.package, access information in, java.util.jar.manifest)', 'reference: (java.lang.class, located in, java.util.jar.manifest)']","[""('package', 'containment', 'class'): (java.lang.package, located in, java.util.jar.manifest)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (java.lang.class, located in, java.util.jar.manifest)""]"
From the Class object you can access the superclass of the class.,,[]
"The superclass class object is a Class object like any other, so you can continue doing class reflection on that too.",,[]
It is possible to get a list of the interfaces implemented by a given class.,,[]
NOTE: Only the interfaces specifically declared implemented by a given class is returned.,,[]
"If a superclass of the class implements an interface, but the class doesn't specifically state that it also implements that interface, that interface will not be returned in the array.",,[]
"Even if the class in practice implements that interface, because the superclass does.",,[]
To get a complete list of the interfaces implemented by a given class you will have to consult both the class and its superclasses recursively.,,[]
You can access the fields (member variables) of a class like this:,,[]
You can access the class annotations of a class like this:,,[]
Using Java Reflection you can inspect the constructors of classes and instantiate objects at runtime.,,[]
The Constructor[] array will have one Constructor instance for each public constructor declared in the class.,"['containment: (constructor[], instance, constructor)']",[]
This example returns the public constructor of the given class which takes a String as parameter:,,[]
"If no constructor matches the given constructor arguments, in this case String.class, a NoSuchMethodException is thrown.","['dependency: (string.class, throws, nosuchmethodexception)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (string.class, throws, nosuchmethodexception)""]"
"The Constructor.newInstance() method takes an optional amount of parameters, but you must supply exactly one parameter per argument in the constructor you are invoking.",,[]
"It is possible to load and reload classes at runtime in Java, though it is not as straightforward as one might have hoped.",,[]
This text will explain when and how you can load and reload classes in Java.,,[]
"You can argue whether Java's dynamic class loading features are really part of Java Reflection, or a part of the core Java platform.",,[]
All classes in a Java application are loaded using some subclass of java.lang.ClassLoader.,,[]
Loading classes dynamically must therefore also be done using a java.lang.ClassLoader subclass.,,[]
"When a class is loaded, all classes it references are loaded too.",,[]
"This class loading pattern happens recursively, until all classes needed are loaded.",,[]
Unreferenced classes are not loaded until the time they are referenced.,,[]
"If a ClassLoader is asked to load a class, it will ask its parent class loader to load it.",,[]
"If the parent class loader can't find the class, the child class loader then tries to load it itself.",,[]
The steps a given class loader uses when loading classes are:,,[]
When you implement a class loader that is capable of reloading classes you will need to deviate a bit from this sequence.,,[]
The classes to reload should not be requested loaded by the parent class loader.,,[]
All you need to do is to obtain a ClassLoader and call its loadClass() method.,"['dependency: (classloader, call, loadclass())', 'access: (classloader, obtain, loadclass())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (classloader, call, loadclass())""]"
Java's builtin Class loaders always checks if a class is already loaded before loading it.,,[]
Reloading the class is therefore not possible using Java's builtin class loaders.,"['dependency: (java.lang.class, not possible using builtin, java.lang.classloader)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.lang.class, not possible using builtin, java.lang.classloader)""]"
To reload a class you will have to implement your own ClassLoader subclass.,,[]
Even with a custom subclass of ClassLoader you have a challenge.,,[]
"This method is final, and thus cannot be overridden in your ClassLoader subclass.",,[]
The resolve() method will not allow any given ClassLoader instance to link the same class twice.,"['check: (resolve(), not allow linking twice, classloader)']",[]
"Therefore, everytime you want to reload a class you must use a new instance of your ClassLoader subclass.",,[]
"This is not impossible, but necessary to know when designing for class reloading.",,[]
As stated earlier you cannot reload a class using a ClassLoader that has already loaded that class once.,,[]
Therefore you will have to reload the class using a different ClassLoader instance.,,[]
"Every class loaded in a Java application is identified by its fully qualified name (package name + class name), and the ClassLoader instance that loaded it.",,[]
"That means, that a class MyObject loaded by class loader A, is not the same class as the MyObject class loaded with class loader B.",,[]
"Notice how the MyObject class is referenced in the code, as the type of the object variable.",,[]
This causes the MyObject class to be loaded by the same class loader that loaded the class this code is residing in.,,[]
"If the myClassReloadingFactory object factory reloads the MyObject class using a different class loader than the class the above code resides in, you cannot cast the instance of the reloaded MyObject class to the MyObject type of the object variable.",,[]
"Since the two MyObject classes were loaded with different class loaders, the are regarded as different classes, even if they have the same fully qualified class name.",,[]
Trying to cast an object of the one class to a reference of the other will result in a ClassCastException.,,[]
"Either of these two methods will work if the type of the variable, the interface or superclass, is not reloaded when the implementing class or subclass is reloaded.",,[]
To make this work you will of course need to implement your class loader to let the interface or superclass be loaded by its parent.,,[]
"When your class loader is asked to load the MyObject class, it will also be asked to load the MyObjectInterface class, or the MyObjectSuperclass class, since these are referenced from within the MyObject class.",,[]
Your class loader must delegate the loading of those classes to the same class loader that loaded the class containing the interface or superclass typed variables.,,[]
Notice how it delegates class loading to its parent except for the one class it is intended to be able to reload.,,[]
"If the loading of this class is delegated to the parent class loader, it cannot be reloaded later.",,[]
"Remember, a class can only be loaded once by the same ClassLoader instance.",,[]
It is not a production ready template for your own class loaders.,,[]
"Your own class loaders should probably not be limited to a single class, but a collection of classes that you know you will need to reload.",,[]
"In addition, you should probably not hardcode the class paths either.",,[]
Here is the reflection.MyObject class that is loaded using the class loader.,,[]
Notice how it both extends a superclass and implements an interface.,,[]
The name of this class is why I refer to these dynamic interface implementations as dynamic proxies.,,[]
As mentioned earlier you must pass an InvocationHandler implementation to the Proxy.newProxyInstance() method.,,[]
The proxy parameter passed to the invoke() method is the dynamic proxy object implementing the interface.,,[]
The Method object passed into the invoke() method represents the method called on the interface the dynamic proxy implements.,,[]
"But now you can check via the mock if the DAO uses the connection properly, for instance if the connection.close() is called (or NOT called), if you expected that.",,[]
Thus the factory interface and your class could look something like this:,,[]
"When the MyAction class calls methods on the IMyFactory instance injected into its constructor by the container, the method calls are translated into calls to the IContainer.instance() method, which is the method you use to obtain instances from the container.",,[]
Using Java Reflection you can inspect the fields (member variables) of classes and get / set them at runtime.,,[]
The Field[] array will have one Field instance for each public field declared in the class.,"['containment: (field[], have one instance for each public field declared in the class, field)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'class'): (field[], have one instance for each public field declared in the class, field)""]"

"Once you have obtained a Field instance, you can get its field name using the Field.getName() method, like this:",,[]
"Once you have obtained a Field reference you can get and set its values using the Field.get() and Field.set()methods, like this:","['access: (field.get(), get values, field)', 'modification: (field.set(), set values, field)']",[]
The objectInstance parameter passed to the get and set method should be an instance of the class that owns the field.,"['alternative: (get, can be used instead of, set)', 'similarity: (get, and, set)', 'access: (get, access, objectinstance)', 'access: (set, access, objectinstance)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (get, can be used instead of, set)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (get, and, set)""]"
"In the above example an instance of MyObject is used, because the someField is an instance member of the MyObject class.",,[]

When you write a class or interface you can specify that it should be paramerizable.,,[]
"Rather than create a list of Object you can parameterize java.util.List to create a list of say String, like this:",,[]
"When inspecting a parameterizable type itself at runtime via reflection, like java.util.List, there is no way of knowing what type is has been parameterized to.",,[]
If you have obtained a java.lang.reflect.Method object it is possible to obtain information about its generic return type.,,[]
Here is an example class with a method having a parameterized return type:,,[]
In this class it is possible to obtain the generic return type of the getStringList() method.,,[]
"In other words, it is possible to detect that getStringList() returns a List<String> and not just a List.",,[]
"This piece of code will print out the text ""typeArgClass = java.lang.String"".",,[]
The Type[] array typeArguments array will contain one item - a Class instance representing the class java.lang.String.,,[]
Here is an example class with a method taking a parameterized List as parameter:,,[]
The Type[] array parameterArgTypes array will contain one item - a Class instance representing the class java.lang.String.,,[]
Fields are class member variables - either static or instance variables.,,[]
The Type[] array fieldArgTypes array will contain one item - a Class instance representing the class java.lang.String.,,[]
Using Java Reflection you can inspect the methods of classes and invoke them at runtime.,"['dependency: (java.lang.class.getmethods(), inspect the methods of classes and invoke them at runtime, java.lang.reflect.method.invoke())', 'access: (java.lang.class.getmethods(), inspect the methods of classes, java.lang.reflect.method.invoke())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (java.lang.class.getmethods(), inspect the methods of classes and invoke them at runtime, java.lang.reflect.method.invoke())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (java.lang.class.getmethods(), inspect the methods of classes, java.lang.reflect.method.invoke())""]"
This can be used to detect what getters and setters a given class has.,,[]

Here is a code example that finds getter and setters of a class:,,[]
The Method[] array will have one Method instance for each public method declared in the class.,,[]

In Java it is possible to dynamically load and also reload classes using a Java ClassLoader.,,[]
"The ClassLoader class is actually not part of the Java Reflection API, but since Java Reflection is often used to achieve ""dynamic"" behaviour (behavioral changes at runtime), and dynamic class loading and reloading kind of fits into this theme, I have decided to include that tutorial in my Java Reflection tutorial.",,[]
Dynamic class loading and reloading is explained in my Java Reflection - Dynamic Class Loading and Reloading tutorial.,,[]
The Java regex API is located in the java.util.regex package which has been part of standard Java (JSE) since Java 1.4.,,[]
"Although Java regex has been part of standard Java since Java 1.4, this Java regex tutorial covers the Java regex API released with Java 8.","['dependency: (java.util.regex.pattern, has been part of, java.lang.string.matches)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (java.util.regex.pattern, has been part of, java.lang.string.matches)""]"
But first I will introduce the core classes of the Java regex API in the following section.,,[]
The Matcher class is used to match a given regular expression (Pattern instance) against a text multiple times.,"['dependency: (matcher, uses, pattern)', 'reference: (matcher, against, pattern)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (matcher, uses, pattern)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (matcher, against, pattern)""]"
Both the Pattern and Matcher classes are covered in detail in their own texts.,"['reference: (pattern, are covered in detail in their own texts, matcher)', 'reference: (matcher, are covered in detail in their own texts, pattern)']","[""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (pattern, are covered in detail in their own texts, matcher)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (matcher, are covered in detail in their own texts, pattern)""]"
The third line uses the Pattern.matches() static method to check if the regular expression (pattern) matches the text.,,[]
"If the regular expression matches the text, then Pattern.matches() returns true.",,[]
If the regular expression does not match the text Pattern.matches() returns false.,,[]
"The example does not actually check if the found http:// string is part of a valid URL, with domain name and suffix (.com, .net etc.).",,[]
"Here is another Java regex example which uses the Matcher class to locate multiple occurrences of the substring ""is"" inside a text:",,[]
The special metacharacter meaning of an escaped metacharacter is ignored - only its actual literal value (e.g.,,[]
Java regular expressions support matching any of a specified set of characters using what is referred to as character classes.,,[]
"The character class (set of characters to match) is enclosed in the square brackets - the [ae] part of the regular expression, in other words.",,[]
"The character class will match one of the enclosed characters regardless of which, but no mor than one.",,[]
"For instance, the character class [a-z] will match all characters between a lowercase a and a lowercase z, both a and z included.",,[]
You can have more than one character range within a character class.,,[]
"For instance, the character class [a-zA-Z] will match all letters between a and z or between A and Z .",,[]
"For instance, the character class [0-9] will match the characters between 0 and 9, both included.",,[]
"If you want to match the square brackets inside a character class, here is how that looks:",,[]
The character class contains the two square brackets escaped (\\[ and \\]).,,[]
You can match digits of a number with the predefined character class with the code \d.,,[]
Matching non-digits can be done with the predefined character class [\D] (uppercase D).,,[]
You can match word characters with the predefined character class with the code \w .,,[]
You can match non-word characters with the predefined character class [\W] (uppercase W).,,[]
Here is a regular expression example using the non-word character class:,,[]
The Java String class has a few regular expression methods too.,,[]
The Java String split() method splits the string into N substrings and returns a String array with these substrings.,,[]
The split() method takes a regular expression as parameter and splits the string at all positions in the string where the regular expression matches a part of the string.,,[]
The Java Matcher class (java.util.regex.Matcher) is used to search through a text for multiple occurrences of a regular expression.,,[]
I will cover the core methods of the Java Matcher class in this tutorial.,,[]
"For a full list, see the official JavaDoc for the Matcher class.",,[]
Here is a quick Java Matcher example so you can get an idea of how the Matcher class works:,,[]
"The matches() returns true if the regular expression matches the text, and false if not.",,[]
You can do a whole lot more with the Matcher class.,,[]
The Pattern class is covered separately in my Java Regex Pattern tutorial.,,[]
Creating a Matcher is done via the matcher() method in the Pattern class.,"['creation: (pattern, creating via the matcher() method in the, matcher())', 'access: (matcher(), done via the method in the pattern class, pattern)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (matcher(), done via the method in the pattern class, pattern)""]"
"The matches() method in the Matcher class matches the regular expression against the whole text passed to the Pattern.matcher() method, when the Matcher was created.","['dependency: (matches(), relies on, matcher())', 'access: (matches(), uses, matcher())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (matches(), relies on, matcher())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (matches(), uses, matcher())""]"
"If the regular expression matches the whole text, then the matches() method returns true.",,[]
You cannot use the matches() method to search for multiple occurrences of a regular expression in a text.,,[]
"For that, you need to use the find(), start() and end() methods.","['dependency: (find(), use, start())', 'dependency: (find(), use, end())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (find(), use, start())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (find(), use, end())""]"
The Matcher lookingAt() method works like the matches() method with one major difference.,"['difference: (matcher.lookingat(), works like with one major difference, matches())', 'alternative: (matcher.lookingat(), works like, matches())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (matcher.lookingat(), works like with one major difference, matches())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (matcher.lookingat(), works like, matches())""]"
"The lookingAt() method only matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text, whereas matches() matches the regular expression against the whole text.","['difference: (lookingat(), only matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text, matches())', 'difference: (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text, lookingat())', 'alternative: (lookingat(), can be used instead of, matches())', 'alternative: (matches(), can be used instead of, lookingat())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), only matches the regular expression against the beginning of the text, matches())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (matches(), matches the regular expression against the whole text, lookingat())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (lookingat(), can be used instead of, matches())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (matches(), can be used instead of, lookingat())""]"
"In other words, if the regular expression matches the beginning of a text but not the whole text, lookingAt() will return true, whereas matches() will return false.","['difference: (lookingat(), return true if matches the beginning but not whole, matches())', 'difference: (matches(), return false if matches the beginning but not whole, lookingat())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (lookingat(), return true if matches the beginning but not whole, matches())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (matches(), return false if matches the beginning but not whole, lookingat())""]"
Matching the regular expression against the beginning of the text (lookingAt()) will return true.,,[]
"Matching the regular expression against the whole text (matches()) will return false, because the text has more characters than the regular expression.",,[]
"The Matcher find() method searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to the Pattern.matcher(text) method, when the Matcher was created.","['dependency: (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to, pattern.matcher())', 'access: (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to, pattern.matcher())', 'check: (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of, pattern.matcher())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to, pattern.matcher())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of the regular expressions in the text passed to, pattern.matcher())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (matcher.find(), searches for occurrences of, pattern.matcher())""]"
"If multiple matches can be found in the text, the find() method will find the first, and then for each subsequent call to find() it will move to the next match.",,[]
The methods start() and end() will give the indexes into the text where the found match starts and ends.,"['access: (start(), give the indexes into the text where the found match starts, text)', 'access: (end(), give the indexes into the text where the found match ends, text)', 'reference: (start(), starts, match)', 'reference: (end(), ends, match)']",[]
Actually end() returns the index of the character just after the end of the matching section.,,[]
"Thus, you can use the return values of start() and end() inside a String.substring() call.","['dependency: (substring(), uses values of, start())', 'dependency: (substring(), uses values of, end())', 'access: (substring(), uses, start())', 'access: (substring(), uses, end())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (substring(), uses values of, start())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (substring(), uses values of, end())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (substring(), uses, start())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (substring(), uses, end())""]"
The Matcher reset() method resets the matching state internally in the Matcher.,,[]
"In case you have started matching occurrences in a string via the find() method, the Matcher will internally keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text.","['dependency: (matcher, keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text, find())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (matcher, keep a state about how far it has searched through the input text, find())""]"
By calling reset() the matching will start from the beginning of the text again.,,[]
"Of course you could do this with the start() and end() methods, but it is easier to do so with the group functions.","['alternative: (start(), easier to do so with, group())', 'alternative: (end(), easier to do so with, group())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (start(), easier to do so with, group())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (end(), easier to do so with, group())""]"
The Matcher replaceAll() and replaceFirst() methods can be used to replace parts of the string the Matcher is searching through.,"['alternative: (replaceall(), can be used instead of, replacefirst())', 'alternative: (replacefirst(), can be used instead of, replaceall())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (replaceall(), can be used instead of, replacefirst())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (replacefirst(), can be used instead of, replaceall())""]"
"The Matcher appendReplacement() and appendTail() methods are used to replace string tokens in an input text, and append the resulting string to a StringBuffer.","['alternative: (appendreplacement(), used to replace string tokens in an input text, appendtail())', 'transfer: (appendreplacement(), append the resulting string to, stringbuffer)', 'transfer: (appendtail(), append the resulting string to, stringbuffer)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), used to replace string tokens in an input text, appendtail())"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (appendreplacement(), append the resulting string to, stringbuffer)"", ""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (appendtail(), append the resulting string to, stringbuffer)""]"
"When you have found a match using the find() method, you can call the appendReplacement().","['dependency: (appendreplacement(), called after, find())', 'check: (appendreplacement(), called after, find())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), called after, find())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (appendreplacement(), called after, find())""]"
"The appendReplacement() method keeps track of what has been copied into the StringBuffer, so you can continue searching for matches using find() until no more matches are found in the input text.","['dependency: (appendreplacement(), uses, find())', 'alternative: (find(), until no more matches are found, appendreplacement())']",[]
By calling appendTail() you can append these last characters to the StringBuffer too.,"['transfer: (appendtail(), append characters to, stringbuffer)', 'access: (appendtail(), access, stringbuffer)', 'modification: (appendtail(), append these last characters to, stringbuffer)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (appendtail(), append characters to, stringbuffer)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (appendtail(), access, stringbuffer)""]"
"Notice how appendReplacement() is called inside the while(matcher.find()) loop, and appendTail() is called just after the loop.","['dependency: (appendreplacement, called inside the loop, find)', 'dependency: (appendtail, called after the loop, find)', 'difference: (appendreplacement, called inside the loop, appendtail)', 'difference: (appendtail, called after the loop, appendreplacement)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (appendreplacement, called inside the loop, find)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (appendtail, called after the loop, find)"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (appendreplacement, called inside the loop, appendtail)"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (appendtail, called after the loop, appendreplacement)""]"
"The Java Pattern class (java.util.regex.Pattern), is the main access point of the Java regular expression API.",,[]
"Whenever you need to work with regular expressions in Java, you start with Java's Pattern class.",,[]
A regular expression is also sometimes referred to as a pattern (hence the name of the Java Pattern class).,,[]
You can use the Pattern.matches() method to quickly check if a text (String) matches a given regular expression.,"['check: (pattern.matches(), matches, string)', 'access: (pattern.matches(), use, string)', 'dependency: (pattern.matches(), if a text matches, string)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (pattern.matches(), use, string)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (pattern.matches(), if a text matches, string)""]"
Or you can compile a Pattern instance using Pattern.compile() which can be used multiple times to match the regular expression against multiple texts.,,[]
The easiest way to check if a regular expression pattern matches a text is to use the static Pattern.matches() method.,,[]
"This Pattern.matches() example searches the string referenced by the text variable for an occurrence of the word ""is"", allowing zero or more characters to be present before and after the word (the two .",,[]
"The Pattern.matches() method is fine if you just need to check a pattern against a text a single time, and the default settings of the Pattern class are appropriate.","['check: (pattern.matches(), check a pattern against a text, pattern)', 'dependency: (pattern.matches(), uses default settings of, pattern)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (pattern.matches(), uses default settings of, pattern)""]"
"If you need to match for multiple occurrences, and even access the various matches, or just need non-default settings, you need to compile a Pattern instance using the Pattern.compile() method.",,[]
"If you need to match a text against a regular expression pattern more than one time, you need to create a Pattern instance using the Pattern.compile() method.",,[]
You can also use the Pattern.compile() method to compile a Pattern using special flags.,,[]
The Java Pattern class contains a list of flags (int constants) that you can use to make the Pattern matching behave in certain ways.,,[]
"For more information of the flags you can use with the Java Pattern class, see the JavaDoc for Pattern .",,[]
The Matcher class has a matches() method that tests whether the pattern matches the text.,,[]
"Too keep this text short, the Matcher covered in more detail in the text about the Java Matcher class.",,[]
"The split() method in the Pattern class can split a text into an array of String's, using the regular expression (the pattern) as delimiter.","['dependency: (split(), uses, pattern)', 'conversion: (split(), converts into, string)', 'reference: (pattern, acts as a, string)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (split(), uses, pattern)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (pattern, acts as a, string)""]"
This Pattern.split() example splits the text in the text variable into 5 separate strings.,,[]
Each of these strings are included in the String array returned by the split() method.,,[]
The pattern() method of the Pattern class simply returns the pattern string (regular expression) that the Pattern instance was compiled from.,"['access: (pattern instance, returns, pattern string)', 'reference: (pattern instance, compiled from, pattern string)']",[]
Character classes are constructst that enable you to specify a match against multiple characters instead of just one.,,[]
"In other words, a character class matches a single character in the input text against multiple allowed characters in the character class.",,[]
Character classes are nested inside a pair of square brackets [].,,[]
"The character class [Jj] will match either a J or a j, and the rest of the expression will match the characters ohn in that exact sequence.",,[]
The Java regular expression syntax has a few predefined character classes you can use.,,[]
"For instance, the \d character class matches any digit, the \s character class matches any white space character, and the \w character matches any word character.","['example: (\\d, matches, \\s)', 'example: (\\d, matches, \\w)', 'example: (\\s, matches, \\w)']","[""('class', 'example', 'class'): (\\d, matches, \\s)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (\\d, matches, \\w)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (\\s, matches, \\w)""]"
"The predefined character classes do not have to be enclosed in square brackets, but you can if you want to combine them.",,[]
The predefined character classes are listed in a table later in this text.,,[]
"The Java GZIPInputStream class (java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream) can be used to decompress files that are compressed with the GZIP compression algorithm, for instance via the GZIPOutputStream class.","['conversion: (java.util.zip.gzipoutputstream, used to compress files that can be decompressed via, java.util.zip.gzipinputstream)']","[""('class', 'conversion', 'class'): (java.util.zip.gzipoutputstream, used to compress files that can be decompressed via, java.util.zip.gzipinputstream)""]"

The Java ZipFile class is used to work with ZIP files containing multiple files.,,[]
The Java GZIPInputStream and GZIPOutputStream classes are used to ZIP compress a single file.,"['alternative: (gzipinputstream, used to zip compress a single file together with, gzipoutputstream)', 'alternative: (gzipoutputstream, used to zip compress a single file together with, gzipinputstream)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (gzipinputstream, used to zip compress a single file together with, gzipoutputstream)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (gzipoutputstream, used to zip compress a single file together with, gzipinputstream)""]"
The above classes will be covered in detail their own tutorials (see the side menu for links).,,[]
The Java ZipFile class (java.util.zip.ZipFile) can be used to read files from a ZIP file.,,[]
This tutorial will show you how to use the ZipFile class.,,[]
In order to use the Java ZipFile class you must first create a ZipFile instance.,,[]
"As you can see, the ZipFile class takes a single parameter in its constructor.",,[]
Each file in the ZIP file is represented by a ZipEntry (java.util.zip.ZipEntry).,,[]
To extract a file from the ZIP file you can call the method getEntry() method on the ZipFile class.,"['access: (getentry(), call ... method on, zipfile)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (getentry(), call ... method on, zipfile)""]"
This example gets a ZipEntry representing the file file1.txt which is contained in the ZIP file.,,[]
The InputStream obtained from the getInputStream() of the ZipFile class can be read like any other Java InputStream.,"['access: (zipfile, getinputstream() of, inputstream)', 'dependency: (inputstream, obtained from, zipfile)', 'example: (inputstream, can be read like any other java, inputstream)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (inputstream, obtained from, zipfile)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (inputstream, can be read like any other java, inputstream)""]"
You can list all entries contained in a ZipFile using the entries() method.,"['access: (entries(), list all entries contained in, zipfile)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (entries(), list all entries contained in, zipfile)""]"
You can iterate the Enumeration returned by the entries() method like this:,,[]
The Zip Slip attack consists of adding entries to a ZipFile that contains relative file paths with one or more /.. sections in the path.,,[]
An entry in the ZipFile has the relative path ../../../../etc/hosts .,,[]
The final path of that entry becomes: /apps/myapp/data/unzipped-file/../../../../etc/hosts which is equivalent of /etc/hosts .,,[]

"Before the challenge is triggered, you must read the value from challenge.getAuthorization() and upload it in a file to your web server.",,[]

"If your code cannot access your web server to upload the challenge file before calling challenge.trigger(), you can run the code in your debugger, set a breakpoint before calling challenge.trigger(), pause the code at that breakpoint, read the token (file name) and authorization (file content) out of the challenge object, upload that to your web server, and then continue the code in the debugger.",,[]
That is what happens in the last part of the processAuth() method.,,[]
"First, the code above waits until the Order object has status Status.VALID.",,[]
The value of that Ant property will be inserted at the place of the ${...} code.,,[]
This example first defines a property named dir.build which has its value set to build.,,[]
"Second, this example defines a property named dir.build.classes which has its value set to ${dir.build}/classes .",,[]
"When Ant defines this property it will resolve the value of the referenced property dir.build, and insert its value where the property is reference.",,[]
"Thus, the second Ant property defined will have its final value set to build/classes because build is the value of the dir.build property referenced.",,[]
"The echo task as defined here will print out the message ""This is version 1.2.3"" to the console.",,[]
"Just to recap, a ""Java build tool"" is a tool which can compile Java code, run the unit tests for it, package the compiled classes into a JAR file and many, many other things.",,[]
This Ant tutorial is based on Ant version 1.9.6 which is the newest version of Ant at the time of writing (august 2015).,,[]
"Inside the project directory you have just created, create an empty file named build.xml.",,[]
"By default Ant looks for a build script named build.xml in your project root directory, so you might as well call your Ant build script build.xml.",,[]
"You could use another name, but using build.xml makes your Ant commands shorter, and it makes it easier for other developers to find the Ant build script.",,[]
Open the build.xml file and insert the following text (XML) into it:,,[]
You can test this build file by opening a command prompt and change directory into the directory that contains the build.xml file and execute this command:,,[]
"This test was performed using Java 5, Butterfly Container 1.9.11-beta, and Guice 1.0.",,[]
"The test performs 10.000.000 instantiations of a TestProduct class using a no-arg constructor, for each DI mechanism.",,[]
Java is a statically typed language meaning that types (primtives and classes) cannot change at runtime.,,[]
"It is not like you can all of a sudden let your Java class members, method parameters and variables be untyped.",,[]
"This is done at the beginning, by the method call BO.setDao(dao).",,[]
"But, notice how no DI is used inside the BO.checkPersonIsValid() or the DAO.readPerson() methods.","['dependency: (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), relies on, dao.readperson())', 'access: (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), uses data from, dao.readperson())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), relies on, dao.readperson())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (bo.checkpersonisvalid(), uses data from, dao.readperson())""]"
I most likely never have to change implementation of the Person class.,,[]
In Java this will result in a class cast exception at runtime (or some similar type error exception).,,[]
"Each factory definition states how a given instance is to be created and configured, when calling the container.instance() method.",,[]

As you can see the constructor call was chained with a call to the setValue() method.,,[]
"Notice how the length() method is called on the ""value"" parameter.",,[]
"If the setValue() method in the example above returns void, the factory will return the SomeObject instance the method was called on.",,[]

"Here is a list of classes and primitives that parameters can be converted to, automatically:",,[]
Sometimes a constructor or method call in a factory definition matches more than one constructor or method in the owning class.,,[]
You can cast to any type or class available on the classpath.,,[]
"To call a static method instead of a constructor when creating an instance of some class, simply write as you would in Java:",,[]
Note: The container uses java.util.ArrayList and java.util.HashSet as the List and Set implementations.,"['alternative: (java.util.arraylist, list implementation, java.util.hashset)', 'alternative: (java.util.hashset, set implementation, java.util.arraylist)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.arraylist, list implementation, java.util.hashset)"", ""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.util.hashset, set implementation, java.util.arraylist)""]"
From version 2.5.9 Butterfly Container Script provides a shortcut to configuring Map instances.,,[]
First an instance of SomeObject is created and then the setValue() method is called on it.,,[]
Below is an example that register the newly created instance with a static method in the MyClass class.,,[]
You can inject instances of classes created locally in a factory definition.,,[]
"Notice how the setNewValue() method is called on the instance obtained from the bean1 factory, before it is injected into OtherObject's constructor.",,[]
"Thus, the setFurtherValue() method of the someObject singleton is called for each instance of bean2 created, even if the method call is redundant.",,[]
"Notice how the bean2 definition obtains an instance from the bean1 factory, and calls the setValue() method on it before returning it.",,[]
"Input parameters can be given to the container.instance() method, like this:",,[]
"The container cannot determine the type of input parameters until runtime, when the container.instance() method is called.",,[]
Therefore it is only possible to call methods that exists in java.lang.Object on input parameters.,,[]
"Your application will ask the container for an object, and the container will make sure that all dependencies (config parameters, collaborating objects, texts etc.)",,[]
"Rather than having to design integration mechanisms yourself, and decide on configuration formats etc., you can have the dependency injection container do all that for you.",,[]
"The ""connectionTimeout"" factory is defined as a singleton returning whatever value the CONNECTION_TIMEOUT constant is set to in the Constants class.",,[]
The simplest way to add a function is to create a static method in a Java class that performs the logic for the function.,,[]
Sometimes you may need to create an instance of some class and call a method on that instance.,,[]
The beanB factory will call the beanA factory with the parameter returned from the static default() method.,,[]
"If input parameter 0 passed to the beanB factory is null, then the default() method will return the default value ""default value"".",,[]
"If you need to call the default() method more than once you can simplify the script a bit by mapping the default method to a factory, and then call this factory whenever the function is needed.",,[]
"The default() method has been mapped to a factory called ""default"".",,[]
This default factory is then called from the beanB factory instead of calling the static default() method directly.,,[]
"There is no package and class name to disturb you when reading the script, and whenever you need the default function all you need to write is ""default(a, b)"", instead of ""com.myapp.util.Util.default(a, b)"".",,[]
Defining the static max() method as a factory (and thereby a function) is done like this:,,[]
"This little script defines the ""max"" factory as a call to the static max() method with input parameter 0 and 1 passed to the max() method.",,[]
"The max factory will call the max() method and return the value that is largest of either the input parameter 0 passed to the beanA factory, or the hard coded value 1.",,[]
"This example uses the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class and defines its instance method parse() as a function called ""toDate"".","['reference: (java.text.simpledateformat, uses, parse())', 'dependency: (java.text.simpledateformat, defines, parse())', 'example: (java.text.simpledateformat, example uses, parse())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (java.text.simpledateformat, defines, parse())""]"
Second the toDate factory is defined as a call to the toDateFactory and then a call to the parse() method on the instance returned from the toDateFactory.,"['dependency: (parse(), call to the, todatefactory())', 'access: (parse(), returned from the, todatefactory())', 'creation: (todatefactory(), a call to the, todate())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (parse(), call to the, todatefactory())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (parse(), returned from the, todatefactory())"", ""('method', 'creation', 'method'): (todatefactory(), a call to the, todate())""]"
The toDate factory takes a single parameter which is the string to parse into a java.util.Date instance.,,[]
"It is possible to extend Butterfly Container Script (BCS) with custom instantiation modes, if the standard modes (new instance, singleton etc.)",,[]
"By calling the set() method with the current request as parameter, the request is associated with the thread calling the set() method.",,[]
By calling the get() method the request object associated with the calling thread can be obtained.,,[]
"The ""request"" factory is defined as a call to the get() method on the product returned from the ""requestCache"" factory.",,[]
"In other words, as a call to the get() method on the HttpRequestCache singleton.",,[]
"The ""session"" factory is defined as a call to the getSession() method of the product returned by the ""request"" factory.",,[]
"In other words, as a call to the getSession() method on the request object obtained from the HttpRequestCache singleton, which is the request object associated with the calling thread.","['access: (getsession(), obtained from, httprequestcache)', 'dependency: (getsession(), relies on, httprequestcache)', 'reference: (getsession(), call ... on ... obtained from, httprequestcache)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (getsession(), obtained from, httprequestcache)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (getsession(), relies on, httprequestcache)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (getsession(), call ... on ... obtained from, httprequestcache)""]"
In order to make the the request and session factories return the correct objects you must first call the HttpRequestCache's set() method.,,[]
"Another disadvantage is that all instantiation modes (singleton, thread singleton, flyweight etc.)",,[]
"If you use an anonymous subclass of JavaFactory, inserted instead of ""new MyFactory()"", the JavaFactoryBuilder cannot access the ""otherFactory"" field, even if it is public.","['alternative: (javafactory, inserted instead of, myfactory())', 'replacement: (javafactory, inserted instead of, myfactory())', 'example: (javafactory, anonymous subclass of, myfactory())']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (javafactory, inserted instead of, myfactory())"", ""('class', 'replacement', 'class'): (javafactory, inserted instead of, myfactory())"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (javafactory, anonymous subclass of, myfactory())""]"
"Inner classes will do just fine too, as long as they are declared ""public static"".",,[]
"This method takes 3 parameters: The name of the factory, the return type of the factory, and a subclass of JavaFactory which implements the factory.",,[]
"The name is used when calling the container.instance(""name"") method to obtain an instance from the factory.",,[]
JavaFactoryBuilder has a method that omits the return type and instead extracts that information from the return type of the JavaFactory subclass's instance method.,"['access: (javafactorybuilder, extracts return type from, javafactory)', 'dependency: (javafactorybuilder, relies on, javafactory)', 'reference: (javafactorybuilder, references, javafactory)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (javafactorybuilder, relies on, javafactory)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (javafactorybuilder, references, javafactory)""]"
Notice how no return type is passed in the addFactory() call.,,[]
Also notice how the return type of the instance() method is now MyObject.,,[]
By declaring a field of type IGlobalFactory in the JavaFactory subclass the JavaFactoryBuilder knows that the factory depends on another factory.,,[]
"You can add as many factories as you want, using the addFactory() method.",,[]
The ScriptFactoryBuilder has a addFactories() method that takes an InputStream as parameter instead of a String.,"['alternative: (addfactories(), takes ... instead of, string)', 'transfer: (addfactories(), takes ... as parameter, inputstream)', 'replacement: (string, replaced by, inputstream)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (addfactories(), takes ... as parameter, inputstream)"", ""('class', 'replacement', 'class'): (string, replaced by, inputstream)""]"
"Using this method you can load a container script from disk, over a network, from the classpath and also from inside a Jar file.",,[]
"To configure the container using a script contained in a file located on the classpath (including inside a Jar file), you can do like this:",,[]
"The init() method creates all singletons, starts services and other stuff that need to be done before the instances in the container can be used.",,[]
The instance() method needs the name of the object factory to get an instance from.,,[]
You can put as many input parameters into the instance() call as you like.,,[]
The input parameters are defined as an optional parameter (Object ... parameters).,,[]
"When the dispose() method is called, the dispose life cycle phase is executed for all factories in the container, before the method call returns.",,[]

"As you can imagine, only the execute() method will grow as the number of localized dependencies grow.",,[]
"Assuming that the MyService class implements an interface called IService, you can create a mock implementation of the IService interface using this code:",,[]
This mockService factory returns a dynamic implementation of the IService interface based on Java's java.lang.reflect.Proxy class.,,[]
"The serviceMock instance passed to the getMock() method should be the mock object obtained from the mockService factory, using the container.instance(""mockService"") method call.",,[]
"In other words, the instance returned from the MockFactory.createProxy() method call.",,[]
This way it is possible to detect if close() is called on the database connection after some method call that uses the connection has completed.,,[]
"A suggestion would be to have a PersonDao.getConnection() method, even though you'd probably mostly use it during testing.",,[]
From version 2.1.9 it is possible to replace factories at runtime.,,[]
"It is also possible to replace several script factories at a time, by using the ScriptFactoryBuilder.replaceFactories(InputStream) method.",,[]
Rather than configuring the PersonDao by hand with dependencies (and their dependencies recursively) you just reuse the configuration of the PersonDao from the application container configuration (the file containerConfig.bcs).,,[]
"When designing Butterfly we considered using an XML format for configuration like several alternative DI containers do (Spring, Nano etc.).",,[]
In this example a java.util.ArrayList() instance is created inside the call to setSomeList().,,[]
As you can see the List.add() method is called twice to add the string and myDataSource factory product to the list.,,[]
The fact One of the advantages you get when designing your own language is the freedom to e.g make methods that return void chainable.,,[]
"The [] around the values in the setSomeList() call signals that the values are to be put inside a List or array, depending on the setSomeList() parameter type.",,[]
It is possible to map classes to tables and columns using annotations.,,[]
You cannot have more than one mapping for the same class using annotation based mapping alone.,,[]
Each annotation is only allowed once in the code for a given class by the Java compiler.,,[]
There are two types of annotations available: A class annotation Annotations for getters and setters.,,[]
AClassMapping The class annotation (AClassMapping) is used ontop of your class name for your POJO classes.,,[]
"If you set the mappingMode to ""modify"" then Butterfly Persistence will first use automatic mapping to guess as much as it can, and then look at the annotations and modify the class mapping accordingly.",,[]
"The tableName element can be set to the name of the table the class is to be mapped to, if it cannot be guessed by the automatic mapping mechanism.",,[]
"If you have a database generated (e.g auto-incremented) primary key that is mapped to a getter method, you will have to mark the getter method as database generated, to avoid having Butterly Persistence try to set that value in the database.",,[]
The class annotation (AClassMapping) is used ontop of your class name for your POJO classes.,,[]
"Notice how the second class definition uses manual mapping, so the getter and setter must be fully mapped to columns in the database.",,[]
The ASetterMapping annotation is used to map setters of classes to columns in database tables or SQL queries.,,[]
In this example the Employee.class object is the object mapping key.,,[]
"However, if you want Butterfly Persistence to be able to auto-map the target class to the database, the object mapping key should be either a Class object, or an IObjectMappingKey instance.",,[]
"The IObjectMappingKey instance can contain more information about the class to be mapped, than a Class object can.",,[]
"An IObjectMappingKey instance has a getObjectClass() method that returns the Class object of the class to map, so automatic mapping is possible in either case.",,[]
When checking for tables with similar names to the class to map only the class name itself is used.,,[]
The ObjectMapper generates various textual combinations based on the class name and checks the database meta data to see if any of these match.,,[]
"The ObjectMapper mapper breaks the class name into words, based on the uppercase letters and numbers in the class name.",,[]
Based on these combinations the PersistentObject class name would be similar to the table names PersistentObject persistentObject persistentobject PERSISTENTOBJECT Persistent_Object persistent_object PERSISTENT_OBJECT PersistentObjects persistentObjects persistentobjects PERSISTENTOBJECTS PERSISTENTOBJECTs Persistent_Objects persistent_objects PERSISTENT_OBJECTS PERSISTENT_OBJECTs As you can see there is a reasonable chance that the table name will be guessed if it is similar to the class name.,,[]
"The Object Mapper uses reflection to iterate the methods of the class to be mapped, and filters out all other methods than getters and setters.",,[]
If your custom mapper implementation returns an object mapping from the getObjectMapping() method then automatic and annotation based mapping are not applied.,,[]
"If a table name is returned from the getTableName() method, then Butterfly Persistence will not try to guess a table name, nor look at the class annotation for table name.",,[]
If null is returned Butterfly Persistence will look at the class annotation to see if a table name is set there.,,[]
If the getObjectMapping() method returned null Butterfly Persistence will call the modify() method to allow your custom object mapper to modify the automatically generated mapping.,,[]
Before doing so Butterfly Persistence will have applied the annotations in the class to the mapping.,,[]
"If you want Butterfly Persistence to manage the opening of connections, pass a javax.sql.DataSource implementation into the constructor of the PersistenceManager.",,[]
The readLong() method comes in another version too which takes an optional list of parameters.,,[]
They will be inserted in the sequence they are passed to the readLong() method.,,[]
"The string (4,5,6,7) is an id string which could be returned by the readIdString() method.",,[]
The readIdString() method comes in a variant that takes an optional list of parameters.,,[]
The IJdbcDao has a few read() methods that allows you to decide what to do with each record in the ResultSet resulting from some SQL query.,,[]
To do so you must provide the read() method with an implementation of the IResultSetProcessor interface.,,[]
The init() method is called before the iteration of the ResultSet begins.,,[]
The process() method is called for each record in the ResultSet The read() method returns an object.,,[]
This is the object is obtained from the getResult() method of the IResultSetProcessor.,,[]
Here is an example of how to use a IResultSetProcessor with the read() methods:,,[]
It may be a good idea to create a base class for your IResultSetProcessor implementations with empty method implementations for init() and perhaps a default behaviour for getResult().,,[]
The read() method comes in a version that takes an optional number of parameters.,,[]
Notice how the number 1975 is passed into the read() method at the end.,,[]
The execute() method should execute the PreparedStatement and return the result of the execution.,,[]
The postProcess() method is normally used to call methods on the PreparedStatement after execution.,,[]
"To read the ids of X records returned from a query into a string of the format (id1, id2, id3, ...) you will do like this:",,[]
"From version 5.3.9 you no longer need to cast the returned object, if you use a Class object as object mapping key.",,[]
You can also parameterize the SQL statement and pass the parameters to the readList() method.,,[]
"This text contains a few examples of how to use the object DAO, IObjectDao, so you can get an idea about how to use the IObjectDao class:",,[]
In addition the Person class and persons table are defined like this:,,[]
"Thus, it doesn't matter how many fields in a class are mapped to columns in the ""items"" table.",,[]
"Therefore you need to create a special object mapping for the given class, that only maps the fields you want to write to columns in the database.",,[]
"The object mapping key could be any object you choose, but if you want help from Butterfly Persistence to map a class to the database, the object mapping key should be either a java.lang.Class object, or an ObjectMappingKey instance.","['alternative: (java.lang.class, be either … or, objectmappingkey)', 'example: (java.lang.class, object, objectmappingkey)', 'reference: (java.lang.class, object, objectmappingkey)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.lang.class, be either … or, objectmappingkey)"", ""('class', 'example', 'class'): (java.lang.class, object, objectmappingkey)"", ""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (java.lang.class, object, objectmappingkey)""]"
"For instance, Employee.class is the object mapping key in the method call below:",,[]
"To enable easy, always-in-time custom object mapping Butterfly Persistence provides the ObjectMappingKey class for advanced object mapping keys.",,[]
Creating an ObjectMappingKey instance is done using the ObjectMappingKey class factory methods.,,[]
"That is because the ObjectMappingKey's factory methods gives each ObjectMappingKey instance a unique id, an int, which is used by its equals() and hashCode() methods.","['dependency: (equals(), used by, hashcode())', 'dependency: (hashcode(), used by, equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (equals(), used by, hashcode())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (hashcode(), used by, equals())""]"

Instead of the class MyCustomObjectMapper you should use your own class.,,[]
The extended class CustomObjectMapperBase is an empty implementation of the ICustomObjectMapper interface.,,[]
Just call the IObjectMapping.removeGetterMapping(String name) or IObjectMapping.removeSetterMapping(String name) method to do so.,"['alternative: (iobjectmapping.removegettermapping, or, iobjectmapping.removesettermapping)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (iobjectmapping.removegettermapping, or, iobjectmapping.removesettermapping)""]"
The ObjectMappingKey class has some static shortcut factory methods to create object mapping keys that has custom object mappers for auto-generated columns.,,[]
The only thing required to use Butterfly Persistence is that you add the JAR file to the classpath of your application.,,[]
"A lot of things are cached internally in the PersistenceManager instance, like object mappings, sql etc., so you should not create a new instance everytime you need it.",,[]
Version control systems typically also makes it easier for multiple people to collaborate - e.g.,,[]
"The Docker base image you are using may itself consist of multiple layers, and can itself be based on another base image etc., until you get down to the most basic Docker image you can create - a raw Linux container image with no special settings applied.",,[]
This example copies a single file from the Docker host at /myapp/target/myapp.jar to the Docker image at /myapp/myapp.jar .,,[]
This example copies the two files /myapp/config/prod/conf1.cfg and /myapp/conig/prod/conf2.cfg into the Docker image directory /myapp/config/ .,,[]
"In other words, you can create a directory inside the docker image, e.g.",,[]
"called /data which can later be mounted to a directory, e.g.",,[]
In a Maven repository a JAR file is identified by its group name (e.g.,,[]
"the organization that made it), its artifact name (the name of the project / software / tool / API), and a version number (e.g.",,[]
"This example declares a dependency on Log4J using the group name log4j, the artifact name log4j and the version 1.2.17 .",,[]
By default the testCompile dependency configuration also includes the compiled classes and the dependencies from the compile dependency configuration.,,[]
The build task will compile all your Java classes and create a JAR file with them in.,,[]
Gradle outputs classes and JAR file to the directory named build inside your project root directory.,,[]
The compiled classes are written to build/classes and the JAR file to build/libs .,,[]
"This is because the classes, jar and assemble tasks are now all UP-TO-DATE from the last run.",,[]
"Running the clean task removes the build directory, and thus all compiled classes and created JAR files.",,[]
"Second, this example calls the myTask doFirst() method, passing along a closure as parameter.",,[]
"Third, this example calls the myTask doLast() method, passing along another closure as parameter.",,[]
"When the task myTask is executed Gradle will first execute all closures passed as parameters the doFirst() method, and then all closures passed as parameters the doLast() method.","['dependency: (mytask, execute ... first ... then ..., dolast())', 'alternative: (dofirst(), then, dolast())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofirst(), then, dolast())""]"
"First of all you do not need the semicolon ; after the doFirst() and doLast() method calls, if the code line with the method calls ends with a new line.","['alternative: (dofirst(), can be used instead of, dolast())', 'similarity: (dofirst(), are similar in not needing semicolons after calls if the line ends with a new line, dolast())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofirst(), can be used instead of, dolast())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (dofirst(), are similar in not needing semicolons after calls if the line ends with a new line, dolast())""]"
"Second, you do not need the parentheses around the closure when calling doFirst() or doLast().","['alternative: (dofirst, or, dolast)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofirst, or, dolast)""]"
With these two syntax optimizations you can write the doFirst() and doLast() method calls like this:,"['alternative: (dofirst(), can write ... like this, dolast())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofirst(), can write ... like this, dolast())""]"
Often you will not need to pass closures to both doFirst() and doLast() .,"['alternative: (dofirst(), alternative to, dolast())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dofirst(), alternative to, dolast())""]"
It is quite common to pass just a single closure to the doLast() method.,,[]
"Because this is such a common use case, Gradle has a shortcut for passing a closure to the doLast() method.",,[]
The two characters << corresponds to calling the doLast() method like this:,,[]
You can even define the task on the same line as you pass the closure to the doLast() method.,,[]
You can also add multiple closures using the doLast() shortcut notation.,,[]
"A task could be compiling the source code, generating JavaDoc, zipping the compiled classes into a JAR file etc.",,[]
The build script is typically called build.gradle and is normally located in the root directory of the project you are building.,,[]
When you specify another build script Gradle does not use its settings.gradle file.,,[]
Gradle will use the build.gradle file found in the project directory (subproject-dir) and will execute the build task in that build script.,,[]

"After creating the two basic functions, a third Predicate is composed, which calls the test() methods of the two first functions.",,[]
The Predicate interface (java.util.function.Predicate) contains a few methods that help you compose new Predicate instances from other Predicate instances.,,[]
The and() method is used to combine two other Predicate functions in the same way I showed in the beginning of this Java functional composition tutorial.,,[]
Here is an example of functional composition with the Predicate and() method:,,[]
This Predicate composition example composes a new Predicate from two other Predicate instances using the and() method of one of the basic Predicate instances.,,[]
The composed Predicate will return true from it's test() method if both of the Predicate instances it was composed from also return true.,,[]
"The Predicate or() method is used to combine a Predicate instance with another, to compose a third Predicate instance.",,[]
"The composed Predicate will return true if either of the Predicate instances it is composed from return true, when their test() methods are called with same input parameter as the composed Predicate.",,[]
This Predicate or() functional composition example first creates two basic Predicate instances.,"['example: (predicate, example, or())', 'creation: (or(), creates, predicate)', 'reference: (example, this, predicate)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (or(), creates, predicate)""]"
"Second, the example creates a third Predicate composed from the first two, by calling the or() method on the first Predicate and passing the second Predicate as parameter to the or() method.",,[]
The Java Function interface (java.util.function.Function) also contains a few methods that can be used to compose new Function instances from existing ones.,,[]
"The Java Function compose() method composes a new Function instance from the Function instance it is called on, and the Function instance passed as parameter to the compose() method.",,[]
"The Function returned by compose() will first call the Function passed as parameter to compose(), and then it will call the Function which compose() was called on.",,[]
"This is easier to understand with an example, so here is a Java Function compose() example:",,[]
The Java Function andThen() method works opposite of the compose() method.,"['alternative: (andthen(), works opposite of, compose())', 'difference: (andthen(), works opposite of, compose())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (andthen(), works opposite of, compose())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (andthen(), works opposite of, compose())""]"
"A Function composed with andThen() will first call the Function that andThen() was called on, and then it will call the Function passed as parameter to the andThen() method.",,[]

The Java Function interface (java.util.function.Function) interface is one of the most central functional interfaces in Java.,,[]
The only method you have to implement to implement the Function interface is the apply() method.,,[]
"This Function implementation implements the apply() method so it takes a Long as parameter, and returns a Long.",,[]
"Second, the example calls the apply() method on the AddThree instance.",,[]
"As you can see, the Function interface implementation is now inlined in the declaration of the adderLambda variable, rather than in a separate class.",,[]
"The Java Predicate interface, java.util.function.Predicate, represents a simple function that takes a single value as parameter, and returns true or false.",,[]
"The Predicate interface contains more methods than the test() method, but the rest of the methods are default or static methods which you don't have to implement.",,[]
"You can implement the Predicate interface using a class, like this:",,[]
This lambda implementation of the Predicate interface effectively does the same as the implementation above that uses a class.,,[]
This Java Consumer implementation prints the value passed as parameter to it out to System.out.,,[]
"Especially the idea of ""no side effects"" makes it hard to e.g.",,[]
"In the functional programming paradigm, functions are first class objects in the language.",,[]
Notice how the return value of the sum() function only depends on the input parameters.,,[]
"Notice also that the sum() has no side effects, meaning it does not modify any state (variables) outside the function anywhere.",,[]
"Notice how the method add() uses a member variable to calculate its return value, and it also modifies the state of the value member variable, so it has a side effect.",,[]
Notice how the createFactory() method returns a lambda expression as result.,,[]
Notice also that the createFactory() method takes two instances as parameters which are both implementations of interfaces (IProducer and IConfigurator).,,[]
Therefore they can be implemented by Java lambda expressions - and therefore the createFactory() method is a higher order function.,,[]
"A function may have local variables containing temporary state internally, but the function cannot reference any member variables of the class or object the function belongs to.",,[]
"State outside of a function refers both to member variables in the class or object the function, and member variables inside parameters to the functions, or state in external systems like file systems or databases.",,[]
"This is still a functional interface, because only run() is not implemented (abstract).",,[]
The first example of a higher order function is the Collections.sort() method which takes a Comparator as parameter.,,[]
The lambda parameter is what makes Collections.sort() a higher order function.,,[]
"Second, the example calls the reversed() method on the Comparator lambda.",,[]
"The reversed() method returns a new Comparator lambda, which reverse the result returned by the first Comparator implementation.",,[]
"By ""reversing"" I mean that it simply returns -1 * comparator.compare(a,b)",,[]
"Because the reversed() method returns a lambda (function), the reversed() method is considered a higher order function.",,[]
"Third, the example sorts the List of Strings using the Collections.sort() method.",,[]
"In contrast, when you are using the Java Collections iteration features (e.g a Java Iterator or the Java for-each loop used with a Java Iterable) you have to implement the iteration of the elements yourself.","['alternative: (java.util.iterator, used with, java.lang.iterable)', 'dependency: (java.util.iterator, implemented by, java.lang.iterable)', 'example: (java.lang.iterable, e.g a java iterator or the java for-each loop used with, java.lang.iterable)']","[""('interface', 'alternative', 'interface'): (java.util.iterator, used with, java.lang.iterable)"", ""('interface', 'dependency', 'interface'): (java.util.iterator, implemented by, java.lang.iterable)""]"

The map() method will be covered in more detail later on.,,[]
Notice how the second call to Stream map() is called on the Stream returned by the first map() call.,,[]
The Java Stream filter() can be used to filter out elements from a Java Stream.,"['access: (filter(), used to filter out elements from, stream)', 'dependency: (filter(), operates on, stream)', 'modification: (filter(), removes elements from, stream)', 'containment: (stream, contains, filter())']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (filter(), used to filter out elements from, stream)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (filter(), operates on, stream)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (stream, contains, filter())""]"
Here is an example of calling the Java Stream filter() method:,,[]
The Java Stream map() method converts (maps) an element to another object.,,[]
The Java Stream flatMap() methods maps a single element into multiple elements.,,[]
This example should give you an idea about how flatMap() can be used to map a single element into multiple elements.,,[]
This Java Stream flatMap() example first creates a List with 3 strings containing book titles.,"['creation: (flatmap, creates, list)', 'containment: (list, contains, flatmap)']","[""('method', 'creation', 'class'): (flatmap, creates, list)"", ""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (list, contains, flatmap)""]"

"Thus, the resulting List (from calling collect()) will only contain one, two and three.",,[]
The Java Stream limit() method can limit the number of elements in a stream to a number given to the limit() method as parameter.,,[]
The limit() method returns a new Stream which will at most contain the given number of elements.,,[]

The peek() method returns a new Stream which contains all the elements in the original stream.,,[]
"The purpose of the peek() method is, as the method says, to peek at the elements in the stream, not to transform them.",,[]
It is the call to count() at the end of the example that is the terminal operation.,,[]

The full code for the command line argument parsers is listed at the end of this tutorial (it's just one class).,,[]
The interpretation of these command line arguments could be that the copy program should copy file.txt to a file named file2.txt and overwrite file2.txt if it already exists.,,[]
These command line arguments consists of one switch (-overwrite) and two targets (file.txt and file.2.txt).,,[]
"When the switch -overwrite is removed, the two arguments file.txt and file2.txt remain.",,[]
The command line argument parser consists of a single Java class named CliArgs.,,[]
The CliArgs class takes an array of String as argument to its constructor.,,[]
The CliArgs class contains the following methods you can use to obtain switch information and values:,,[]
The switchPresent() method can be used to ask if a given switch is present or not.,,[]
"If the command line arguments contains the -overwrite switch anywhere, the switchPresent() method will return true.",,[]
The switchValue() method can be use to obtain the value of a switch.,,[]
Here is a code example showing how to use switchValue() to read the value of the -port switch:,,[]
If you want the value of a switch parsed into a long or double you can use the switchLongValue() and switchDoubleValue() methods.,"['alternative: (switchlongvalue(), can use ... instead of, switchdoublevalue())', 'alternative: (switchdoublevalue(), can use ... instead of, switchlongvalue())', 'conversion: (switchlongvalue(), parsed into a long, switchlongvalue())', 'conversion: (switchdoublevalue(), parsed into a double, switchdoublevalue())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (switchlongvalue(), can use ... instead of, switchdoublevalue())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (switchdoublevalue(), can use ... instead of, switchlongvalue())""]"
The switchValues() method is used to obtain multiple values for a switch.,,[]
The switchValues() method will return all values after the switch and until the next switch is met (next argument starting with a - character).,,[]
The values of the -from switch will be file1.txt and file2.txt.,,[]
The values of the -to switch will be copy1.txt and copy2.txt.,,[]
Instead you can create a swith POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class to hold all the switches.,,[]
"You can now read all the switches from the command line directly into an instance of the CliSwitches class, using the switchPojo() method.",,[]
The CliArgs switchPojo() method will use the property names inside the class to match against switches in the command line.,,[]
The targets() method returns all the arguments which are not switches or switch values.,,[]
"The CliArgs class distinguishes between switch values and targets by assuming, that all arguments which have not been ""taken"" already as switch values must be targets.",,[]
"will the method targets() as executed in the code above, return the String",,[]

"You can also see that iterating an ArrayList using a standard Java for loop with a counter, and obtaining each element by calling the ArrayList get() method is about 10% faster for an ArrayList with 10 elements, and around 12,5% faster when the ArrayList contains 100 elements.",,[]
The OpenArrayList class is a very simple imitation of the ArrayList which I have implemented to see if it could iterate a collection of elements faster than an ArrayList .,,[]
"This should be a tiny bit faster than calling the ArrayList get() method, although the JVM could optimize the get() method call away.",,[]
Another advantage of making the elements array public is that you can write to it or copy from it using System.arraycopy() which is very fast.,,[]
The fact that the performance is so close is probably a sign that the JVM has optimized the get() call away.,,[]
"As you can see, the readMyData() method returns a MyData object.",,[]
What is worth noting about this read pattern is that every time you call the readMyData() method a new MyData object is returned.,,[]
If the readMyData() method is called frequently that will lead to a lot of MyData objects being created.,,[]
Here is how the earlier readMyData() method would look using the read-into-existing pattern:,,[]
"It is now up to the caller of the readMyData() method to decide if an existing MyData instance should be reused, or if a new instance should be created.",,[]
Reusing an object also means that the chance the object is located in the CPU cache is much higher than when you create a new object for each call to the readMyData() method.,,[]
To change the previous example code to read data directly from the underlying source we need to change the implementation of the MyData class:,,[]
"To use the MyData class in its new variation, you will use code like this:",,[]
Just call setSource() when you need to read data out of a new byte array.,,[]
"Third, only if you actually call both getVal1() and getVal2() will the corresponding data be read out of the underlying byte array.","['dependency: (getval1(), only if you actually call both ... will the corresponding data be read, getval2())', 'access: (getval1(), read out of the underlying byte array, getval2())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getval1(), only if you actually call both ... will the corresponding data be read, getval2())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (getval1(), read out of the underlying byte array, getval2())""]"
"Assuming that each MyData object consists of 2 bytes from the underlying source, here is how the MyData class would look with a navigation method added:",,[]
The first change is the that the setSource() method now takes an extra parameter called offset.,,[]
The second change is that the getVal1() and getVal2() methods now use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array when reading values out.,"['alternative: (getval1, used instead of, getval2)', 'similarity: (getval1, now use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array when reading values out, getval2)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (getval1, used instead of, getval2)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (getval1, now use the value of the internal offset variable as index into the source array when reading values out, getval2)""]"
"The next() method increments the internal offset variable by 2, so that the offset variable points to the next record in the array.",,[]
The fourth change is the addition of the hasNext() method which returns true if the source byte array has more records (bytes) in it.,,[]
"As you can see, using the MyData class in the navigator pattern implementation is pretty straightforward.",,[]
"Additionally, if your server works on many tasks at the same time (e.g incoming HTTP requests), the other CPUs in your server may already be busy working on their own tasks.",,[]
"My own experiences come from from a mix of Java performance experiments, as well as the design and development of VStack.co - a fully hosted application backend which I have cofounded with WorpCloud Ltd.",,[]
"The Java ArrayList class only works for objects - not for primitive types (byte, int, long etc).",,[]
The code consist of 3 Java classes and 2 unit tests.,,[]
100.000 x 1MB = 100GB (approximately - not precisely - but you get the picture).,,[]
"Note, that in languages with built-in garbage collection (like Java, C# etc.)",,[]
Even at 4GB (1.000.000 x 4KB) modern servers should be able to handle it.,,[]
"Additionally, if you use a small block size, you may have to expand blocks more often than if you use e.g.",,[]
"To obtain a ResizableArray instance, call the ResizableArrayBuffer's getArray() method, like this:","['access: (resizablearray, obtain ... call ... getarray(), getarray())', 'dependency: (resizablearray, depends on, getarray())', 'creation: (resizablearray, create ... call ... getarray(), getarray())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (resizablearray, depends on, getarray())""]"
The ResizableArray class in the GitHub repository only contains a single write() method which takes a ByteBuffer as parameter.,"['dependency: (write(), takes, bytebuffer)', 'access: (write(), takes, bytebuffer)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (write(), takes, bytebuffer)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (write(), takes, bytebuffer)""]"
"It should be pretty easy to add more write() methods yourself, though.",,[]
The value returned by write() is the number of bytes copied from the ByteBuffer.,"['transfer: (write(), copies from, bytebuffer)', 'access: (write(), returns bytes from, bytebuffer)']","[""('method', 'transfer', 'class'): (write(), copies from, bytebuffer)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (write(), returns bytes from, bytebuffer)""]"
"If the ResizableArray cannot contain all the data in the ByteBuffer after expanding itself to the max size, the write() method will return -1 and no data will have been copied at all!",,[]
"You do so simply by calling the free() method on the ResizableArray, like this:",,[]
"Calling free() takes care of returning the used block to the correct block queue, regardless of the size of the block allocated to the ResizableArray.",,[]

"The JMH Maven archetype will generate a new Java project with a single, example benchmark Java class, and a Maven pom.xml file.",,[]
The Maven pom.xml file contains the correct dependencies to compile and build your JMH microbenchmark suite.,,[]
"It is time to write your first JMH benchmark class, or at least see how it is done.",,[]
The generated MyBenchmark class is a JMH class template which you can use to implement your JMH benchmarks.,,[]
"You can either implement your benchmarks directly in the generated MyBenchmark class, or create a new class in the same Java package.",,[]
To make it easy for you to write your first JMH benchmark I will just use the generated class in this example.,,[]
You can put the code you want to measure inside the testMethod() method body.,,[]
"For now, just imagine that the testMethod() body actually contained a good benchmark implementation.",,[]
"When you build your JMH benchmarks, Maven will always generate a JAR file named benchmarks.jar in the target directory (Maven's standard output directory).",,[]
It contains your compiled benchmark classes as well as all JMH classes needed to run the benchmark.,,[]
"If your benchmarks has any external dependencies (JAR files from other projects needed to run your benchmarks), declare these dependencies inside the Maven pom.xml, and they will be included in the benchmarks.jar too.",,[]
"Since benchmarks.jar is fully self contained, you can copy that JAR file to another computer to run your JMH benchmarks on that computer.",,[]
This means that you want the output shown using the time unit minutes (e.g.,,[]
"State variables are declared in special state classes, and an instance of that state class can then be provided as parameter to the benchmark method.",,[]
In this example I have added a nested static class named MyState.,,[]
Notice that the testMethod() benchmark method now takes an instance of MyState as parameter.,,[]
Notice also that the testMethod() body has now been changed to use the MyState object when performing its sum calculation.,,[]
Notice the two new methods in the MyState class named doSetup() and doTearDown().,"['alternative: (dosetup(), can be used instead of, doteardown())', 'similarity: (dosetup(), similar to, doteardown())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (dosetup(), can be used instead of, doteardown())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (dosetup(), similar to, doteardown())""]"
"If you have any doubts about when a setup or tear down method is called, try inserting a System.out.println() statement in the method.",,[]
"If your benchmark method is calculating multiple values that might end up being eliminated as dead code, you can either combine the two values into a single, and return that value (e.g.",,[]
Notice how the testMethod() benchmark method now takes a Blackhole object as parameter.,,[]
Notice also how the calculated sum in the sum variable is now passed to the consume() method of the Blackhole instance.,,[]
"If your benchmark method produces multiple results you can pass each of these results to a black hole, meaning calling consume() on the Blackhole instance for each value.",,[]
"The JVM could even continue and never call the testMethod() because it knows it always returns 3, and just inline the constant 3 wherever the testMethod() was to be called.",,[]
Sometimes a lot of time is even spent just allocating and freeing memory (e.g.,,[]
"When you control object allocation, deallocation and reallocation you can make limits like e.g.",,[]
having a maximum of 10.000 messages in memory at a time.,,[]
"The batch size can thus vary from 1 to a maximum upper limit set by the system, e.g.",,[]
"To achieve lower latency, yet allowing for micro batching to happen, you can loop over the input channels (inbound network connections, directories etc.)",,[]
Therefore it can be beneficial to batch up data sent outside a process to minimize the overhead per data block (e.g.,,[]
"Instead of traversing the whole data structure to serve just one ""request"" (task, message etc.)",,[]
Notice how two different DAO's were called from inside the control's execute() method.,,[]
"To make this happen you need to obtain a database connection (or equivalent object) inside the Control.execute() method, and pass this connection (or other object) to each DAO.",,[]
"Well, you could if you call a setConnection() method on them afterwards.",,[]
The DaoManager is a class that you put in between the Control and the DAO's.,,[]
Once the DaoManager.executeAndClose() method finishes the database connection inside the DaoManager is closed.,,[]
"As you can see from the code example in the previous section, the scope of the connection when managed by the DaoManager.executeAndClose() is the boundaries of the executeAndClose() method.",,[]
This could be the case in a desktop application if each control is registered independently as listeners on e.g.,,[]
It is the DaoManager's executeAndClose() method that demarcates the life span of the underlying connection.,,[]
"If you call this method from each control's execute() method (or whatever the central execution method in your controls is called), each control will open and close a connection separately.",,[]
The ScopingDataSource will be moved to Butterfly Persistence from around version 5.2.0 or 5.4.0 which will be released in 2009.,,[]
The ScopingDataSource is an implementation of the standard Java interface javax.sql.DataSource.,,[]
"Once this method is called, whenever the tread that called this method calls the ScopingDataSource.getConnection() method, the same connection instance is returned.",,[]
"This ScopingConnection ignores all calls to the close() method, so the underlying connection can be reused.",,[]
"When you are ready to close the connection your control calls the ScopingDataSource.endConnectionScope(), and the currently open connection (if any) is closed.",,[]
"From here on the ScopingDataSource behaves just like a regular DataSource, returning a new Connection for every call to getConnection().","['creation: (datasource, returning a new, connection)', 'access: (getconnection(), call to, datasource)', 'dependency: (getconnection(), behaves just like, datasource)', 'creation: (datasource, returning a new connection for every call to getconnection(), connection)']","[""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (datasource, returning a new, connection)"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (getconnection(), call to, datasource)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (getconnection(), behaves just like, datasource)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (datasource, returning a new connection for every call to getconnection(), connection)""]"
"The calls to beginConnectionScope() and endConnectionScope() do not have to be located within the same method, nor within the same class.",[],[]
"You can just extend the DBControlBase and override the doExecute() method, then all connection scoping is done for you.",,[]
"They can be called outside the Control.execute() method too, or inside a parent control.",,[]
"If your Control class implements an interface, you can implement a Dynamic Proxy which implements the same interface.",,[]
"When the execute() method is called on the control interface, this dynamic proxy will call the beginConnectionScope(), then call your controls execute() method, and finally the endConnectionScope().","['dependency: (execute(), call then call, beginconnectionscope())', 'dependency: (execute(), call finally, endconnectionscope())', 'implementation: (beginconnectionscope(), before then finally, endconnectionscope())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (execute(), call then call, beginconnectionscope())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (execute(), call finally, endconnectionscope())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (beginconnectionscope(), before then finally, endconnectionscope())""]"
The only difference is that you call beginTransactionScope() and endTransactionScope() instead.,"['alternative: (begintransactionscope, instead of, endtransactionscope)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (begintransactionscope, instead of, endtransactionscope)""]"
"When a connection is obtained from the ScopingDataSource while inside a transaction scope, connection.setAutoCommit(false) is called.",,[]
"If an exception is thrown before the endTransactionScope() method is called, you should catch that exception and call abortTransactionScope(Exception) with that exception.","['dependency: (endtransactionscope(), should be called before, aborttransactionscope())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (endtransactionscope(), should be called before, aborttransactionscope())""]"
The first problem you run into when designing DAO classes is connection scoping.,,[]
A naive implementation of a DAO class using JDBC to target a relational database might look like below (at least I have designed DAO's like this in the past).,,[]
Notice how the readPerson() method opens its own connection and closes it again once it is done.,,[]
You might also be able to hide connection closing from the domain logic by adding a close() method to the DAO.,,[]
But somewhere in the domain logic you would have to call that close() method.,,[]
The method call daoFactory.beginConnectionScope() marks the beginning of a connection scope.,,[]
The method call daoFactory.endConnectionScope() ends the current connection scope and closes the connection associated with the scope.,,[]
This way neither of the DAO's need to have close() methods.,,[]
The methods beginTransaction() and endTransaction() mark the beginning and end of the transaction.,"['alternative: (begintransaction, mark the beginning and end, endtransaction)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (begintransaction, mark the beginning and end, endtransaction)""]"
The beginTransaction() method will call connection.setAutoCommit(false) for the connection associated with the transaction scope.,"['dependency: (begintransaction, call, setautocommit)', 'implementation: (begintransaction, call, setautocommit)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (begintransaction, call, setautocommit)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (begintransaction, call, setautocommit)""]"
The endTransaction() method will attempt to commit the transaction and call setAutoCommit(false) again.,"['dependency: (endtransaction(), call, setautocommit())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (endtransaction(), call, setautocommit())""]"
Notice the new method call in the catch-block of the transaction scope: daoFactory.abortTransaction(e).,,[]
This method call rolls the transaction back if an exception is thrown from any of the dao methods or from endTransaction().,,[]
"The DAO layer usually consists of a smaller set of classes, than the number of domain logic classes that uses it.",,[]
"It is also a somewhat more controlled operation, since you can search for all DAO classes, and make sure they are changed to use the new persistence mechanism.",,[]
"To solve the problems mentioned earlier, you can move some of the code to a DaoManager class.",,[]
Notice that the getPersonDao() method isn't synchronized even though it returns a kind of singleton.,,[]
"Rather than implementing a close() method in the DaoManager class, a template method will be added called executeAndClose().",[],[]
This instance then has it's execute() method invoked with the DaoManager itself as parameter.,,[]
Now the scope of the connection is marked by the scope of the method call executeAndClose().,,[]
"Any exception handling related to the connection.close() call can be hidden away inside the executeAndClose() method, and reused throughout the application.","['dependency: (`connection.close()`, can be hidden away inside, `executeandclose()`)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (`connection.close()`, can be hidden away inside, `executeandclose()`)""]"
You can add a transaction() method similar to the executeAndClose() method which takes care of transaction management.,"['alternative: (transaction(), similar to, executeandclose())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (transaction(), similar to, executeandclose())""]"
"For instance, if both commit() and rollback() throws exceptions, both of these exception are not properly preserved or handled.","['alternative: (commit(), alternative to, rollback())', 'similarity: (commit(), similarity with, rollback())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (commit(), alternative to, rollback())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (commit(), similarity with, rollback())""]"
Using the transaction() method is analogous to using the executeAndClose() method:,"['alternative: (transaction(), is analogous to using, executeandclose())', 'similarity: (transaction(), is analogous to using, executeandclose())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (transaction(), is analogous to using, executeandclose())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (transaction(), is analogous to using, executeandclose())""]"
This could be done by wrapping the call to transaction() inside the call to executeAndClose().,"['dependency: (transaction(), wrapped inside, executeandclose())', 'containment: (transaction(), inside, executeandclose())']",[]
"As you can see a DaoManager class can solve the problems of marking both connection life span and transaction boundaries, and automatically open and close connections and commit / rollback transactions.",,[]
"If you implement a base event listener class that all event listeners (or actions, or whatever your framework calls them) extend, you can put the DaoManager code in that class (or a subclass of the base class).",,[]
Here is an example of a subclass that executes the persistence code marked in bold in the first code box in this section:,,[]
Now your domain logic class only contains the persistence code that is actually interesting.,,[]
It may not always be possible or feasible to implement such a persistence action base class.,,[]
It would be tempting to put that validation code inside the doPersistenceAction() method.,,[]
"But remember, a connection has been opened already when the DaoManager is instantiated, which happens before the doPersistenceAction() method is called.",,[]
"Furthermore, if the validation fails and aborts the doPersistenceAction() method call, you have opened a connection without ever using it.",,[]
"If you are using a persistence API you will inject whatever class you obtain connections or their equivalents from (sessions in Hibernate, IDaos in Butterfly Persistence).",,[]
"This is done to avoid obtaining the connection before the DaoCommand.execute() method is called, to postpone obtaining the connection as much as possible.",,[]

Remember to replace the class name with the fully qualified name of your own GZip Servlet filter class.,,[]
"In general, If no header exists with the name passed to getHeader(), null is returned.",,[]
"NOTE: You will have to call this method before calling any getParameter() method, because calling the getParameter() method on an HTTP POST request will cause the servlet engine to parse the HTTP request body for parameters.",,[]
"For instance, you can access context parameters set in the web.xml file, you can forward the request to other servlets, and you can store application wide parameters in the ServletContext too.",,[]
In order to write binary data back to the browser you cannot use the Writer obtained from response.getWriter().,,[]

You can have as many test methods in a unit test class as you want.,,[]
This is how simple a unit test can be with JUnit 4.8.2 .,,[]
"As you may have figured out from the simple test, most of the secret of implementing JUnit unit tests, is in the use of the assert methods in the class org.junit.Assert.","['containment: (org.junit.assert, contains, assert)', 'access: (junit unit tests, use, assert methods)', 'reference: (assert methods, in, org.junit.assert)']","[""('class', 'containment', 'method'): (org.junit.assert, contains, assert)""]"
In this text I will take a closer look at what assert methods are available in this class.,,[]
"The code for this class is not shown, but you don't really need the code in order to understand how to test it.",,[]
The assertArrayEquals() method will test whether two arrays are equal to each other.,,[]
"To check for element equality, the elements in the array are compared using their equals() method.",,[]
"More specifically, the elements of each array are compared one by one using their equals() method.",,[]
"Second the myUnit.getTheStringArray() method is called, which is the method we want to test.",,[]
"Third, the result of the myUnit.getTheStringArray() method call is compared to the expected array.",,[]
"If the arrays are equal, the assertArrayEquals() will proceed without errors.",,[]
"The assertEquals() method compares two objects for equality, using their equals() method.","['dependency: (assertequals, uses, equals)', 'reference: (assertequals, compares using, equals)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (assertequals, uses, equals)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (assertequals, compares using, equals)""]"
"First the myUnit.concatenate() method is called, and the result is stored in the variable result.",,[]
"Second, the result value is compared to the expected value ""onetwo"", using the assertEquals() method.",,[]
"If the two objects are equal according to their implementation of their equals() method, the assertEquals() method will return normally.","['dependency: (assertequals(), will return normally if equal according to, equals())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (assertequals(), will return normally if equal according to, equals())""]"
"Otherwise the assertEquals() method will throw an exception, and the test will stop there.",,[]
"This example compared to String objects, but the assertEquals() method can compare any two objects to each other.",,[]
The assertEquals() method also come in versions which compare primitive types like int and float to each other.,,[]
"The assertTrue() and assertFalse() methods tests a single variable to see if its value is either true, or false.","['alternative: (asserttrue, can be used instead of, assertfalse)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (asserttrue, can be used instead of, assertfalse)""]"

"If the myUnit.getTheObject() returns null, the assertNull() method will return normally.",,[]
"If a non-null value is returned, the assertNull() method will throw an exception, and the test will be aborted here.",,[]

The assertSame() and assertNotSame() methods tests if two object references point to the same object or not.,"['alternative: (assertsame(), tests if two object references point to the same object or not, assertnotsame())', 'difference: (assertsame(), tests if two object references point to the same object, assertnotsame())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (assertsame(), tests if two object references point to the same object or not, assertnotsame())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (assertsame(), tests if two object references point to the same object, assertnotsame())""]"
It is not enough that the two objects pointed to are equals according to their equals() methods.,,[]
The calls to myUnit.getTheSameObject() are inlined into the assertSame() and assertNotSame() method calls.,"['dependency: (getthesameobject(), are inlined into, assertsame())', 'dependency: (getthesameobject(), are inlined into, assertnotsame())', 'alternative: (assertsame(), and, assertnotsame())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getthesameobject(), are inlined into, assertsame())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (getthesameobject(), are inlined into, assertnotsame())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (assertsame(), and, assertnotsame())""]"
"If the two references points to the same object, the assertSame() method will return normally.",,[]
"If the two objects do not poin to the same object, the assertNotSame() method will return normally.",,[]
The assertThat() method compares an object to an org.hamcrest.Matcher to see if the given object matches whatever the Matcher requires it to match.,"['check: (assertthat, compares ... to see if the given object matches, org.hamcrest.matcher)', 'dependency: (assertthat, relies on, org.hamcrest.matcher)', 'reference: (assertthat, refers to, org.hamcrest.matcher)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (assertthat, relies on, org.hamcrest.matcher)"", ""('method', 'reference', 'class'): (assertthat, refers to, org.hamcrest.matcher)""]"
"If you are testing a component that uses a database, e.g.",,[]
"a DAO class, you may want to test that the component really inserts data into the database, updates it etc.",,[]
It is just a standard Java class - nothing secret about it.,,[]
"Exactly what methods you will put in your own TestData class, depends on the data used by your application.",,[]
"Also, you may want some of the methods to take parameters, rather than e.g.",,[]
"Once you have such a TestData class, you can use and reuse it in your unit tests.",,[]
"The TestData class can contain all kinds of business wise complex test data setups, which are then easy to setup in the database, once they have been programmed once.",,[]
"Below is a diagram illustrating a unit test, a unit (which is being tested), and a dependency which is some class used by the unit.",,[]
"If a method or field is private, only instances of that class can access that method or field.",,[]
"A protected method or field, on the other hand, is also accessible to other classes in the same package, and for subclasses of the unit too.",,[]
"By encapsulating calls to external dependencies (components) in protected methods, you can create a subclass mock of the unit to test, and override these protected methods, to make them record information about whether they were called or not.",,[]
"By ""boundary class"" I mean classes that plug into some framework.",,[]
You may need the whole framework running in order to test your boundary class.,,[]
"Examples of boundary classes are Servlets, Struts actions, custom Swing components, EJB's etc.",[],[]
Each of these boundary classes need a larger framework or server running in order to test them.,,[]
"A way to get around that is to move the business logic out of the boundary class, and into it's own component.",,[]
Make sure that the business logic component does not know anything about the boundary classes.,,[]
"For instance, if your boundary class is a servlet, your business logic class should not know anything about the HttpRequest or HttpResponse interfaces.","['dependency: (business logic class, should not know anything about, httprequest)', 'dependency: (business logic class, should not know anything about, httpresponse)']",[]
"Preferably, the business logic class only takes the parameters it needs, as the types it needs.",,[]
"When your business logic class is separated from the boundary class, you can test the business logic class separately.",,[]
"When the boundary classes are minimized to dispatch logic, the risk of errors in them are a lot smaller, in case you choose not to unit test them.",,[]
"For an example of this, see the Servlet Unit Testing text, in which I show how to unit test the business logic of a servlet, by moving the business logic to a separate class.",,[]
In this text I will give a few suggestions to how you can test such classes.,,[]
Let's look at how to write a unit test for this class.,,[]
The ByteArrayInputStream is then used as input into the MyIOUnitTest.read() method.,"['transfer: (bytearrayinputstream, used as input into, myiounittest.read())', 'dependency: (myiounittest.read(), relies on, bytearrayinputstream)']","[""('class', 'transfer', 'method'): (bytearrayinputstream, used as input into, myiounittest.read())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (myiounittest.read(), relies on, bytearrayinputstream)""]"
Here is the unit test which uses a ByteArrayOutputStream to collect the data written to the OutputStream passed to the MyIOUnit.write() method:,"['transfer: (bytearrayoutputstream, collects the data written to, outputstream)', 'dependency: (bytearrayoutputstream, uses, outputstream)', 'transfer: (bytearrayoutputstream, collect the data written to, write())', 'dependency: (outputstream, passed to, write())']","[""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (bytearrayoutputstream, collects the data written to, outputstream)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (bytearrayoutputstream, uses, outputstream)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'method'): (bytearrayoutputstream, collect the data written to, write())"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (outputstream, passed to, write())""]"
"Notice how the output.toByteArray() method is called, and passed into a String.",,[]
"If your input or output component uses a Reader or Writer instead of an InputStream or OutputStream, you can use the classes CharArrayReader and CharArrayWriter instead of ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream.","['alternative: (reader, can use ... instead of, inputstream)', 'alternative: (writer, can use ... instead of, outputstream)', 'alternative: (chararrayreader, instead of, bytearrayinputstream)', 'alternative: (chararraywriter, instead of, bytearrayoutputstream)']",[]
You may also be able to use the StringReader and StringWriter classes in your unit tests.,"['alternative: (stringreader, use ... instead of ..., stringwriter)']",[]
"Unit testing means testing the smaller units of your application, like classes and methods.",,[]
"JUnit 4.8.2 ships with Hamcrest internally, so you don't have to download it, and add it yourself.",,[]
"Matchers are used with the org.junit.Assert.assertThat() method, which looks like this:",,[]
"The assertThat() method just takes care of the ""plumming"" - meaning calling the Matcher with the given object.",,[]
"In the example above, the org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is() method is used to create a Matcher.",,[]
"The Matcher returned by is() returns true, if the two values compared are equal, and false if not.","['similarity: (is(), returns true if equal, equals())', 'similarity: (is(), returns false if not equal, equals())']","[""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (is(), returns true if equal, equals())"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (is(), returns false if not equal, equals())""]"
"The is() method returns one matcher, and the not() method returns another.","['alternative: (is(), returns one matcher, not())', 'difference: (is(), returns one matcher, not())', 'alternative: (not(), returns another, is())', 'difference: (not(), returns another, is())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (is(), returns one matcher, not())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (is(), returns one matcher, not())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (not(), returns another, is())"", ""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (not(), returns another, is())""]"
The matcher returned by not() negates the matcher output of the matcher given as input.,,[]
"In this case, it is the output of the matcher returned by the is() method, that is negated.",,[]
You can write your own matchers and plug into the assertThat() method.,,[]
The static method matches() creates a new matcher and returns it.,,[]
You just embed the call to the static method matches() inside the assertThat() method.,"['dependency: (assertthat(), embed inside, matches())', 'check: (assertthat(), call, matches())', 'access: (assertthat(), call, matches())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (assertthat(), embed inside, matches())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (assertthat(), call, matches())"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (assertthat(), call, matches())""]"
In several situations mock testing is easier than testing with the real collaborators of a class.,,[]
When testing a DAO you may use a mock java.sql.Connection and java.sql.ResultSet object with the DAO to check that the DAO makes the correct JDBC calls.,"['alternative: (java.sql.connection, use ... with, java.sql.resultset)', 'dependency: (java.sql.connection, use ... with, java.sql.resultset)']","[""('class', 'alternative', 'class'): (java.sql.connection, use ... with, java.sql.resultset)"", ""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (java.sql.connection, use ... with, java.sql.resultset)""]"
It is not visible from the value returned by the DAO if it remembered to call ResultSet.close() and Connection.close() before returning.,"['dependency: (dao, remembered to call, resultset.close())', 'dependency: (dao, remembered to call, connection.close())']",[]
The above situation was exactly the case for the GenericDao class in Mr. Persister.,,[]
Ideally the JDBC driver would detect that when calling the PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() method.,,[]
Therefore we decided to compare the PreparedStatement.getParameterMetaData().getParameterCount() with parameters.length before calling PreparedStatement.executeUpdate().,"['check: (preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount, compared before calling, preparedstatement.executeupdate)', 'dependency: (preparedstatement.executeupdate, depends on, preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount)', 'access: (preparedstatement.getparametermetadata, gets, preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount)']","[""('method', 'check', 'method'): (preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount, compared before calling, preparedstatement.executeupdate)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (preparedstatement.executeupdate, depends on, preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount)"", ""('method', 'access', 'method'): (preparedstatement.getparametermetadata, gets, preparedstatement.getparametermetadata.getparametercount)""]"
"This works with the HSQLDB driver, but the MySQL driver haven't implemented the PreparedStatement.getParameterMetaData() method.",,[]
Fortunately the MySQL driver does throw an exception if the ?-signs and the parameters set doesn't match when calling PreparedStatement.executeUpdate().,,[]
"In the classpath element I add the output locations of my project code, and test code.",,[]
In the test element I declare which unit test class to execute.,,[]
The classpath stuff is the same as in the first example.,,[]
"In this example I execute all files that has the text ""Test"" and "".java"" in their file name, regardless of what directory they are located in, recursively.",,[]
"What I usually do instead, is to ""move the code out of the boundary class"", as I have described in the text Design for Testability.",,[]
"Basically, I would try to push the main business logic in the servlet into a separate class which has no dependencies on the Servlet API's, if possible.",,[]
"So, I will take the concatenation logic and move into a separate class, which can be tested independent from the MyServlet class.",,[]
Notice how the concatenation logic has been moved to a class called MyConcatenator.,,[]
Notice how the concatenate() method only refers to a string array.,,[]
Notice again how it was not necessary to reference any servlet classes or interfaces in this unit test.,,[]
By real objects I mean the objects the tested unit (class) will be using in the real application.,,[]
"If you have a class Calculator, that needs a dao (Data Access Object) object to load the data it needs from a database, then the dao object is a ""real object"".",,[]
In order to test the Calculator class you will have to provide it with a dao object that has a valid connection to the database.,,[]
Instead you can provide the Calculator instance with a fake dao class which just returns the data you need for the test.,,[]
The fake dao class will not actually read the data from the database.,,[]
A replacement for a real object which makes it easier to test the Calculator class.,,[]
Nor can you see if the connection.close() method was called before returning the value.,,[]
"If you add a String ""myReturnValue"" as return value to the stub and then call connection.prepareStatement(""select * from houses"") which returns a PreparedStatement, you will get an exception.","['creation: (string, add, preparestatement)', 'dependency: (preparestatement, returns, preparedstatement)', 'access: (preparestatement, call, preparedstatement)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'interface'): (preparestatement, returns, preparedstatement)"", ""('method', 'access', 'interface'): (preparestatement, call, preparedstatement)""]"
"The String return value cannot be returned from the connection.prepareStatement(""...""); You will have to make sure yourself that the return values and called methods on the stub match.",,[]
If the connection.close() method has not been called a java.lang.AssertionError is thrown.,"['check: (java.lang.assertionerror, thrown if not called, connection.close())', 'dependency: (java.lang.assertionerror, depends on, connection.close())']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'method'): (java.lang.assertionerror, depends on, connection.close())""]"
You just provide the real collaborator to the MockFactory instead of an interface (class object).,,[]
You can even turn the proxyConnection into a stub temporarily by adding a return value to the proxy via the mock.addReturnValue(...).,,[]
"Subclass mock objects is a mock object that is created by subclassing the class you want to test, and overriding some of its methods.",,[]
The class MyUnit is the class I am trying to unit test.,,[]
"In this unit test, I want to check if the MyUnit class calls the MyDependency class correctly.",,[]
"The first thing to do is to refactory the MyUnit class, so that all calls to the MyDependency class are encapsulated in their own methods.","['dependency: (myunit, calls, mydependency)', 'access: (myunit, are encapsulated in their own methods, mydependency)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (myunit, calls, mydependency)""]"
"Notice how the two calls to MyDependency.callOne() and MyDependency.callTwo() are now encapsulated in two protected methods, callOne() and callTwo().","['reference: (mydependency.callone(), encapsulated in, callone())', 'reference: (mydependency.calltwo(), encapsulated in, calltwo())', 'implementation: (callone(), encapsulate, mydependency.callone())', 'implementation: (calltwo(), encapsulate, mydependency.calltwo())']","[""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (mydependency.callone(), encapsulated in, callone())"", ""('method', 'reference', 'method'): (mydependency.calltwo(), encapsulated in, calltwo())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (callone(), encapsulate, mydependency.callone())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (calltwo(), encapsulate, mydependency.calltwo())""]"
The second step is to create a subclass mock of the MyUnit class.,,[]
Here is a unit test method that uses the MyUnitMock class:,,[]
"Third, assertions are made about whether the callOne() and callTwo() method were invoked.","['alternative: (callone(), invoked instead of, calltwo())', 'alternative: (calltwo(), invoked instead of, callone())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (callone(), invoked instead of, calltwo())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (calltwo(), invoked instead of, callone())""]"
"As you can see, it is possible to test almost all of a class by using subclass mocks, as described above.",,[]
"There are, however, situations where it works better to use a completely separate mock dependency object with the original class instead.",,[]
"If the throwIllegalArgumentException() method returns normall, then this fail() call is executed, causing the test to fail.","['dependency: (fail(), is executed causing the test to fail if throwillegalargumentexception() returns normally, throwillegalargumentexception())', 'check: (fail(), is executed if throwillegalargumentexception() returns normally, throwillegalargumentexception())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (fail(), is executed causing the test to fail if throwillegalargumentexception() returns normally, throwillegalargumentexception())"", ""('method', 'check', 'method'): (fail(), is executed if throwillegalargumentexception() returns normally, throwillegalargumentexception())""]"
"Correspondingly, if the throwIllegalArgumentException() method throws the expected IllegalArgumentException, it is caught in the catch-clause, and ignored.",,[]
"Instead you want users trying to access your web app to see a nice ""This web app is down for maintenance..."" page.",,[]
"A ""This web app is down for maintenance..."" page lets them know that the down time is controlled and expected.",,[]
Here is how the web.xml configuration looks for such a setup:,,[]
"For instance, imagine that a user sends a request that takes 1 minute to process (e.g.",,[]
"I've posted the full solution including the servlet filter Java code, the web.xml configuration, the maintenance message page and the maintenance GUI page, for your convenience below.",,[]
"Apparently the field name ""comment"" caused the text (""Comment..."") in the textarea not to show up in Firefox... weird, right...?!",,[]
"In order to get a Java web server or servlet container to run your Java web application, you need to package the resources inside it (servlets, JSP's etc.)",,[]
... then the index.jsp page will be accessible at the URL,,[]
"For instance, if you create a subdirectory called layout, and put a file inside it called theLayout.jsp, then you could access that file from the outside, via this URL:",,[]
"Inside the WEB-INF directory there are two important directories (classes and lib, and one important file (web.xml).",,[]
"The web.xml file contains information about the web application, which is used by the Java web server / servlet container in order to properly deploy and execute the web application.",,[]
"For instance, the web.xml contains information about which servlets a web application should deploy, and what URL's they should be mapped to.",,[]
I will not get into more detail about the web.xml file here.,,[]
The classes directory contains all compiled Java classes that are part of your web application.,,[]
"The classes should be located in a directory structure matching their package structure, just like if you were to run them directly from the commandline, or package them in a JAR file.",,[]
"You could, however, also put your own classes into a JAR file, and locate it here, rather than putting those classes in the classes directory.",,[]
Perl or C. A Servlet is an ordinary Java class that implements a special Servlet interface.,,[]
"Here is a small servlet and JSP example to better illustrate the difference: public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response){ PrintWriter writer = ((HttpServletResponse) response)).getWriter(); writer.write(""<html>""); writer.write(""<body>""); writer.write(""<table>""); for(int i=0; i<10; i++){ writer.write(""<tr><td>""); writer.write("""" + i); writer.write(""</td></tr>""); } writer.write(""</table>""); writer.write(""</body>""); writer.write(""</html>""); } <html> <body> <table> <% for(int i=0; i<10; i++){ %><tr><td><%=i%></td></tr><% } %> </table> </body> </html> As you can see, the JSP example is much shorter than the Servlet example, and it is much easier to get an overview of the HTML.","['access: (httpservletresponse, getwriter(), printwriter)', 'dependency: (printwriter, depends on, httpservletresponse)', 'transfer: (printwriter, writes, httpservletresponse)', 'creation: (httpservletresponse, creates, printwriter)']","[""('class', 'dependency', 'class'): (printwriter, depends on, httpservletresponse)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (printwriter, writes, httpservletresponse)"", ""('class', 'creation', 'class'): (httpservletresponse, creates, printwriter)""]"
This is illustrated below: component.control --> component.control --> component.control --> component.control --> component.control component.view --> component.view --> component.view --> component.view --> component.view First all components in the hierarchy executes their control logic (domain logic).,,[]

"A Fat JAR is a single JAR file that contains all the compiled Java classes from your project, and all compiled Java classes from all JAR files your project depends on (see Maven Dependencies).",,[]
"Fat JARs are handy when you need to build an executable JAR file, e.g.",,[]
"This makes execution much easier, because you don't have to list all the JAR files your microservice depends on, on the classpath.",,[]
"When you execute Maven package phase with the maven-assembly-plugin configuration shown earlier, Maven will output a Fat JAR in the target directory, into which Maven outputs all of its other build products (e.g.",,[]

"Too look at the list of available Maven archetypes, you can pipe the output into a file, and open that file in e.g.",,[]
"Keep in mind, that when you execute the clean goal of Maven, the target directory is removed, meaning you lose all compiled classes from previous builds.",,[]
"That means, that Maven will have to build all of your project again from scratch, rather than being able to just compile the classes that were changed since last build.",,[]
"However, sometimes it can be nice to have a clean, fresh build, e.g.",,[]
The pom.xml file is the Maven POM file (Project Object Model).,,[]
The .mvn directory is a directory where you can put some Maven configuration files.,,[]
One of these Maven configuration files is the jvm.config file which can be used to configure the Java VM that is used by Maven to build your project.,,[]
The resource files will be available for loading via the classpath.,,[]
The default Java compiler version used by Maven is Java 1.5 .,,[]
"To make Maven compile your Java code with a newer version of the Java compiler, you need to specify the Java compiler explicitly in your project's POM file (pom.xml).",,[]
Notice also that the version of the Maven Java compiler plugin has changed from 3.6.1 to 3.8.0 .,,[]
The first version of this Maven tutorial is based on Maven 3.6.3.,,[]
The POM file is named pom.xml and should be located in the root directory of your project.,,[]
"This command first executes the clean build life cycle, which removes compiled classes from the Maven output directory, and then it executes the install build phase.",,[]
These JAR files are needed on the classpath when you compile your project code.,,[]

"Thus Maven only needs to download the dependencies once, even if multiple projects depends on them (e.g.",,[]
Your Maven settings file is also located in your user-home/.m2 directory and is called settings.xml.,,[]
"The clean life cycle handles everything related to removing temporary files from the output directory, including generated source files, compiled classes, previous JAR files etc.",,[]
One way to choose what profile is being executed is in the settings.xml file.,,[]

Calling free() will free the Bytes instance back to the ObjectPool and the allocated bytes back to the BytesAllocatorAutoDefrag.,,[]
"In this section I will try to give you a few visual use case examples that shows how to use the Bytes class, and its fields.",,[]
"The use cases are actually quite similar in how they use the Bytes class, even if they are doing different things.",,[]
The Mem Ops BytesAllocatorAutoDefrag class is capable of allocating smaller sections (blocks) of a bigger byte array.,,[]
"When you free a byte array section, the BytesAllocatorAutoDefrag class will automatically defragment its internal big byte array so the freed section is joined with adjacent free sections to form a larger free section from which future sections can be allocated.",,[]
To use the BytesAllocatorAutoDefrag class you must first create an instance of it.,,[]
"In order to allocate a block (section) of bytes from the underlying byte array, you call the allocate() method.",,[]
"Once allocated, no other allocate() call can allocate the same block until it has been freed.",,[]
"The allocate() method returns the offset into the big, underlying byte array where the allocated block starts.",,[]
You can get a reference to the underlying byte array via the getData() method.,,[]
"Once you have allocated a block of bytes from the BytesAllocatorAutoDefrag you can access it via the data array, from the offset returned by allocate() and until offset + length - 1.",,[]
The free() method takes the start and end offset of the block to free.,,[]
The Mem Ops BytesAllocatorManualDefrag class is capable of allocating smaller sections (blocks) of a bigger byte array.,,[]
"When you free a byte array section, the ByteArrayAllocatorAutoDefrag class will mark it as free, but will not defragment the underlying byte array until you explicitly to tell it to.",,[]

"Once you have allocated a block of bytes from the BytesAllocatorManualDefrag you can access it via the data array, from the offset returned by allocate() and until offset + length - 1.",,[]
To defragment the free blocks you call the defragment() method of the BytesAllocatorManualDefrag .,,[]
It is during such idle times you should call defragment() .,,[]
"If your system is constantly very busy, there may never be an idle period during which to call defragment().",,[]
Calling defragment() will most likely result in a longer pause than if you immediately defragment free blocks like the ByteArrayAllocatorAutoDefrag does.,,[]

A module can only see the classes from itself or from its dependencies (modules) and transitive dependencies.,,[]
"A module cannot see classes from modules ""above"" itself in the dependency graph.",,[]
The JVM will consider classes loaded from the two different versions of the API as different classes because they are loaded with different ClassLoader instances.,,[]
Each instance of the module have the classes loaded from its dependency graph isolated from the other instances of the same module (at least it can - if you want to).,,[]
Loading the classes from each module with its own ClassLoader makes application multi tenancy easier.,,[]

The RionWriter class has functionality that helps you reserve length bytes for composite RION fields and jump back up and fill them in correctly later.,,[]
One of the mechanisms in the RionWriter class that helps you reserve length bytes and set their value correctly later requires an internal stack to keep track of where the reserved length bytes are located.,,[]

The readBytes() method will start fromByte bytes into the block file.,,[]
The Stream Ops for Java class named StreamStorageRootFS (com.nanosai.streamops.engine.storage.file.StreamStorageRootFS) class represents the root of a file based stream storage system.,"['reference: (streamstoragerootfs, represents, com.nanosai.streamops.engine.storage.file.streamstoragerootfs)']","[""('class', 'reference', 'class'): (streamstoragerootfs, represents, com.nanosai.streamops.engine.storage.file.streamstoragerootfs)""]"
You can always obtain the root directory path a StreamStorageRootFS was created with via its getRootDirPath() method.,,[]
Here is an example of obtaining the root directory path of a StreamStorageRootFS via its getRootDirPath() method:,,[]
"When you write records to a stream via the StreamStorageFS instance, the StreamStorageFS class will divide the records into multiple files.",,[]
Creating a Buffer is done using the static buffer() method in the Buffer interface.,"['creation: (buffer.buffer(), creating a buffer is done using the, buffer)']",[]
If you want the bytes stored in the Buffer to be encoded using a special encoding (e.g.,,[]
"you can specify the encoding as the second parameter to the buffer() method, like this:",,[]
You can read the length of a Buffer using its length() method.,,[]
You can write to a specific position inside a buffer using one of the set...() methods.,,[]
You can also write data to a Buffer using one of the append...() methods.,,[]
You can read the data stored in a Buffer using the many get...() methods.,,[]
After the vertx run part of the command you must write the fully qualified class name of the verticle to deploy.,,[]
To deploy a verticle class you must run the vertx run classname command from the root directory of the compiled classes for the verticle to deploy.,,[]
"Thus, the root directory of your classes becomes the classpath for deploying the verticle.",,[]
Whatever directory you run the vertx run command from is automatically added to the classpath when looking for the verticle class.,,[]
You can also run a Java verticle class which is located inside a JAR file.,,[]
Sometimes you need a classpath which contains more than one directory or JAR file.,,[]
In those situations you can provide a normal classpath string as the -cp argument value.,,[]
Each entry (directory or JAR file) in the classpath string must be separated by either a semicolon (on Windows) or a colon (on Unix / Linux).,,[]
This example contains two JAR files in the classpath separated by a semicolon.,,[]
"If you have a very long classpath your command line may get very long, and thus be hard to read in a text editor.",,[]
"Instead you can build the classpath up as an environment variable, one entry per line, and use that environment variable in the command line.",,[]
run.cmd and you can execute it from a Windows command line.,,[]
Notice the use of / as directory separator and the use of : as classpath entry separator.,,[]
That might be useful if you deploy a class file that is written in Groovy or Scala (but which are compiled into Java classes).,,[]
The first parameter to the getNow() method is the TCP port to connect to the remote HTTP server on.,,[]
The getNow() method exists in a version where you can leave the port out.,,[]
The second parameter to the getNow() method is the domain name of the remote HTTP server to connect to.,,[]
The third parameter to the getNow() method is the URI to the resource to retrieve.,,[]
The Handler implementation passed to the getNow() method is called when the headers of the HTTP response are received.,,[]
"However, if you do need to access the body of the HTTP response, you need to register another handler on the HttpClientResponse that is passed as parameter to the first Handler's handle() method.","['access: (handle(), access the body of, httpclientresponse)', 'dependency: (handle(), passed as parameter to, handler)', 'transfer: (httpclientresponse, passed as parameter to, handler)']","[""('method', 'access', 'class'): (handle(), access the body of, httpclientresponse)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (handle(), passed as parameter to, handler)"", ""('class', 'transfer', 'class'): (httpclientresponse, passed as parameter to, handler)""]"
The Handler implementation passed to the bodyHandler() method of the HttpClientResponse is called when the full HTTP response body is received.,"['dependency: (bodyhandler(), passed to the ... method of the, httpclientresponse)', 'implementation: (bodyhandler(), is called when the full http response body is received, httpclientresponse)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (bodyhandler(), passed to the ... method of the, httpclientresponse)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (bodyhandler(), is called when the full http response body is received, httpclientresponse)""]"
"Once you have created the HTTP server, you can start it using its listen() method.",,[]
"The HttpServer class has more versions of the listen() method too, which gives you different options for starting the HTTP server.","['access: (httpserver, has versions of, listen())']",[]
"Every time an HTTP request arrives at the HTTP server, the handle() method of the Handler object is called.",,[]
Inside the handle() method you can execute the code needed to handle the HTTP request.,,[]
You can access HTTP headers and parameters from the HttpServerRequest object passed as parameter to the handle() method.,"['access: (httpserverrequest, passed as parameter to, handle())', 'dependency: (handle(), relies on, httpserverrequest)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (handle(), relies on, httpserverrequest)""]"
"After writing the headers back you can write the response body back via the write() method, like this:",,[]
You can call write() multiple times to add more data to the response body.,,[]
The write() method is asynchronous and returns immediately after queuing up the string or buffer.,,[]
This is done by calling the end() method as shown in the previous example.,,[]
The end() method can take either a String or Buffer as parameter.,,[]
To close an HTTP server you simply call its close() method like this:,,[]
"The close() method executes asynchronously, so the HTTP server may not be fully closed by the time the close() method returns.",,[]
"You can pass a close handler as parameter to the close() method, to be notified when the HTTP server is fully closed.","['dependency: (close(), pass a close handler as parameter to, close())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (close(), pass a close handler as parameter to, close())""]"
"You can just unzip the zip file and add these JAR files to the classpath of your Java application, and you are good to go.",,[]
As long as the JAR files are available on the classpath of your application.,,[]
You connect to a remote server by calling the connect() method.,,[]
You obtain a reference to the NetSocket connected to the remote server via the AsyncResult instance passed to the handler's handle() method.,,[]
You can write data to the TCP connection via the NetSocket write() method.,,[]
The data may not be sent by the time the write() method returns.,,[]
The Handler's handle() method will get called when data is received from the remote server.,,[]
You close the TCP client by calling the close() method of the NetClient instance.,,[]
"Again, the NetClient's close() method is asynchronous, so the underlying TCP connection may not yet be closed by the time the close() method returns.",,[]
"Once you have created the TCP server, you can start it using its listen() method.",,[]
This example starts the server and instructs it to listen on TCP port 10.000 .,,[]
The NetServer class contains more versions of the listen() method which gives you different options for starting the TCP server.,,[]
The handle() method of the connect handler is called whenever a new TCP connection is created by a client of the TCP server.,,[]
The NetSocket object passed as parameter to the handle() method gives access to the incoming connection (socket etc.,,[]
You can do so via the NetSocket instance passed to the connect handler's handle() method.,"['access: (handle(), passed to, connect())', 'access: (handle(), access, netsocket)', 'dependency: (connect(), uses, netsocket)']","[""('method', 'access', 'method'): (handle(), passed to, connect())"", ""('method', 'access', 'class'): (handle(), access, netsocket)"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (connect(), uses, netsocket)""]"
The NetSocket class contains more versions of the write() method which enables you to write e.g.,,[]
When you are finished with the TCP server you can close it using its close() method.,,[]
"Closing the TCP server is an asynchronous actions, so the close() method may exit before the TCP server is actually closed.",,[]
"If you need to be notified of when the TCP server has shut down, you can pass a Handler to the close() method.","['dependency: (close(), can pass a, handler)', 'implementation: (close(), pass a, handler)']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'class'): (close(), can pass a, handler)"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'class'): (close(), pass a, handler)""]"
"The setTimer() method takes a time interval in milliseconds as first parameter, and a Handler implementation as second parameter.",,[]
The Handler's handle() method is called when the time interval has elapsed.,,[]
This timer ID is also passed as parameter to the Handler's handle() method.,,[]
"The setPeriodic() method takes a time interval in milliseconds as first parameter, and a Handler implementation as second parameter.",,[]
The Handler's handle() method is called every time the time interval has elapsed.,,[]
This timer ID is also passed to the Handler's handle() method whenever it is called.,,[]
Support for Scala and Clojure should be arriving soon (it was originally planned for v. 3.0 but I am not sure if they got it in).,,[]
You don't have to learn both a language and a new platform (e.g.,,[]
You will see later in this tutorial how to use both versions of the start() method.,,[]
Here is an example of overriding the stop() method in your own verticle:,,[]
Sending messages via the event bus can be done via either the send() or publish() method on the event bus.,"['alternative: (send(), can be done via either ... or, publish())']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (send(), can be done via either ... or, publish())""]"
The send() method sends the message to just one of the listening verticles.,,[]
This is useful for distributing work load over multiple verticles (e.g.,,[]
"The first message is sent via the publish() method, so both consumers receive the message.",,[]
"The second message is sent via the send() method, so only one of the consumers will receive the message.",,[]
A verticle has a start() and a stop() method which are called when the verticle is deployed and when it is undeployed.,"['implementation: (start(), called when the verticle is deployed, stop())', 'implementation: (stop(), called when the verticle is undeployed, start())']","[""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (start(), called when the verticle is deployed, stop())"", ""('method', 'implementation', 'method'): (stop(), called when the verticle is undeployed, start())""]"
"You should perform any necessary initialization work inside the start() method, and any necessary cleanup work inside the stop() method.","['dependency: (start(), initialization work, stop())', 'dependency: (stop(), cleanup work, start())']","[""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (start(), initialization work, stop())"", ""('method', 'dependency', 'method'): (stop(), cleanup work, start())""]"
"For instance, you can specify how many verticle instances of a given verticle class to deploy.",,[]
The startsWith() and endsWith() methods check if the String starts with a certain substring,"['alternative: (startswith, can be used instead of, endswith)', 'similarity: (startswith, similar to, endswith)']","[""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (startswith, can be used instead of, endswith)"", ""('method', 'similarity', 'method'): (startswith, similar to, endswith)""]"

The floor() method does the opposite of the ceiling() method meaning it returns the greatest element that is less than or equal to the given parameter value,"['difference: (floor(), does the opposite of, ceiling())', 'alternative: (floor(), can be used instead of, ceiling())']","[""('method', 'difference', 'method'): (floor(), does the opposite of, ceiling())"", ""('method', 'alternative', 'method'): (floor(), can be used instead of, ceiling())""]"
You can also specify METHOD or FIELD or you can leave the target out alltogether so the annotation can be used for both classes methods and fields,,[]
