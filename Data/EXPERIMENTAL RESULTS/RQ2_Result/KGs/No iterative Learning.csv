The Collections reverse() method can reverse the elements in a Java List.,[]

"A Java interface is a bit like a Java class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields.",[]
The class does not need to implement (declare) the variables of an interface.,[]
"You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, and reference that instance as an instance of the interface.",[]
